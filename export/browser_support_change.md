title: Browser support change: End of support for Microsoft Internet Explorer
categories: changes
---

We will phase out support for Microsoft's Internet Explorer (IE 11), since our user base for this web browser is continuously decreasing and has significantly fallen below 1.5%. Please switch to a more recent and [supported browser](http://www.uniprot.org/help/browser%5Fsupport) in order to enjoy the full functionalities of the UniProt website.

Even if you are not using IE 11, it may be a good idea to look at the list of the browsers we support and consider switching to the most recent version of [your browser](https://whatismybrowser.org/) for the best user experience and security.
