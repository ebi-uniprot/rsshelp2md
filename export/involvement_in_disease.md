This subsection of the 'Pathology and Biotech' section provides information on the disease(s) associated with genetic variations in a given protein. The information is extracted from the scientific literature and diseases that are also described in the [OMIM](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=omim) database are represented with a [controlled vocabulary](http://www.uniprot.org/diseases) in the following way:

Disease name (Disease abbreviation) \[Link to OMIM\]: Disease description.

An optional "Note=" field is used to describe the role of the gene/protein in disease pathogenesis and distinguish, when possible, between causative, susceptibility and modifier genes according to literature and OMIM reports.

Examples: [Q01718](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q01718#pathology%5Fand%5Fbiotech), [Q15198](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q15198#pathology%5Fand%5Fbiotech), [P51800](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P51800#pathology%5Fand%5Fbiotech) and [P51801](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P51801#pathology%5Fand%5Fbiotech), [Q6W5P4](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q6W5P4#pathology%5Fand%5Fbiotech), [P52895](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P52895#pathology%5Fand%5Fbiotech) and [P17516](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P17516#pathology%5Fand%5Fbiotech).

The "Note=" field is also used to indicate the role of a protein in disease manifestation in cases where the protein is functionally impaired although the corresponding coding gene does not contain any mutation.

Examples:

[P15289](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P15289#pathology%5Fand%5Fbiotech) (causative gene [Q8NBK3](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q8NBK3#pathology%5Fand%5Fbiotech))

[Q15465](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q15465#pathology%5Fand%5Fbiotech) (causative gene [Q8WVP7](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q8WVP7#pathology%5Fand%5Fbiotech))

[Q9NR56](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9NR56#pathology%5Fand%5Fbiotech) (causative gene [Q09013](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q09013#pathology%5Fand%5Fbiotech))

The accession numbers of OMIM entries that describe a phenotype (or a gene and phenotype) are shown in this subsection, as well as in the 'Organism-Specific Databases' subsection of the ['Cross-references'](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/cross%5Freferences%5Fsection) section, which also provides links to OMIM entries that describe the gene itself.

Examples: [Q01718](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q01718#pathology%5Fand%5Fbiotech), [P84996](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P84996#pathology%5Fand%5Fbiotech)

Chromosomal rearrangements (translocations, inversions) are also described in this subsection.

Examples: [P11308](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P11308#pathology%5Fand%5Fbiotech), [Q15532](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q15532#pathology%5Fand%5Fbiotech), [Q16385](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q16385#pathology%5Fand%5Fbiotech)"

If the sequence position of the translocation breakpoint is known and causes a fusion protein, it is annotated in the ['Site'](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/site) subsection.

Example: In Q8IZP0 the annotation in the ['Pathology and Biotech'](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q8IZP0#pathology%5Fand%5Fbiotech%5Fsection) section is completed by information at the sequence level ( ['Site'](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/site) subsection).

Disease information that is not described in OMIM is annotated as free text.

Examples: [P00395](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P00395#pathology%5Fand%5Fbiotech), [Q02388](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q02388#pathology%5Fand%5Fbiotech)
