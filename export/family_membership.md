**How is protein family membership assigned in UniProtKB?**

The task of assigning proteins to families makes use of a range of sources
including protein family databases, sequence analysis tools, scientific literature
and sequence similarity search tools.

InterPro integrates predictive signatures representing protein domains,
families and functional sites into a single resource from a number of
family and domain databases: Gene3D, PANTHER, Pfam, PIRSF, PRINTS, ProDom,
PROSITE, SMART, SUPERFAMILY and TIGRFAMs. Use is made of InterPro and its
member databases in assigning UniProtKB proteins to families.

Protein families for which no predictive signatures exist are defined through
sequence similarity searches combined with use of scientific literature
and sequence analysis tools. Factors such as end-to-end similarity with
other family members and shared organisation such as common domain order
and topology are considered. These newly identified families are passed
to InterPro and its member databases to facilitate creation of
new signatures which in turn leads to detection of additional family
members.

The full list of protein families in UniProtKB and the entries which belong
to each family is available [here](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/similar).
