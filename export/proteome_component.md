A UniProt [proteome](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/proteomes%5Fmanual) can consist of several components.

The component name refers to the genomic component encoding a set of proteins.

These range from a single component such as Viral genomes to several components as in the case of eukaryotic chromosomes. They may also represent different stages in a genome project and include components such as contigs, scaffolds or Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) master records.
