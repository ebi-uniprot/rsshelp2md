This subsection of the 'PTM / Processing' section describes the extent of a polypeptide chain in the mature protein following processing or proteolytic cleavage.

The processing events that may contribute to the formation of a mature chain are described in the '[Initiator methionine](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/init_met)', '[Propeptide](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/propep)', '[Signal](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/signal)' and '[Transit peptide](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/transit)' subsections.

The 'description' field of the 'chain' corresponds to the recommended name listed in the '[Protein names](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/protein_names)' subsection.  
  
Example: [Q6UB98](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q6UB98#ptm_processing)

When several chains are produced from the same precursor, each chain is described in this subsection and is also listed in the [Names and taxonomy](http://www.uniprot.org/help/names%5Fand%5Ftaxonomy%5Fsection) section, ['Protein name'](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/protein%5Fname) subsection, as "Cleaved into the following x chains:", where 'x' represents the number of chains described in the 'PTM / Processing' section. In both sections, the chains are listed in their order of appearance in the sequence, i.e. from the N- to the C-terminus.  
  
Example: [P07683, 'PTM / Processing'](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P07683#ptm%5Fprocessing) and [P07683, 'Names and taxonomy'](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P07683#names%5Fand%5Ftaxonomy)

Each chain has a [stable identifier](http://www.uniprot.org/help/sequence%5Fannotation#annotation%5Fid).
