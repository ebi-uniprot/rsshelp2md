  UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot major release (52.0)
 </h3>
 <p>
  UniProt Knowledgebase release 10.0 includes Swiss-Prot release 52.0 and TrEMBL release 35.0.
 </p>
 <p>
  UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot release 52.0 of March 6, 2007 contains 260'175 sequence entries,
      comprising 95'002'661 amino acids abstracted from 152'564 references. 18'986 sequences
      have been added since release 51.0: this represents an increase of 7.3%. In addition,
      the annotations of 190'910 entries have been revised.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many improvements were carried out in the last 4 months:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   We have reintroduced the initiator methionine: the UniProtKB sequence data
     now always corresponds to the precursor form of a protein, i.e. before
     post-translational modifications such as cleavage of the signal peptide or
     other events (except of course when the sequence data are derived from direct
     protein sequencing).
  </li>
  <li>
   We have extended the UniProtKB accession number format: we have extended
     the existing accession number format by allowing the first character to be
        any of the 26 letters (instead of only O, P and Q).
  </li>
  <li>
   We have added cross-references to 7 new databases and introduced a new molecule type for the EMBL
       cross-references (Viral_cRNA)
  </li>
 </ul>
