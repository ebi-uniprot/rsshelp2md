 <h3>
  UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot major release (51.0)
 </h3>
 <p>
  UniProt Knowledgebase release 9.0 includes Swiss-Prot release 51.0 and TrEMBL release 34.0.
 </p>
 <p>
  Release 51.0 of 31-Oct-06 of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot contains 241'242 sequence entries,
     comprising 88'541'632 amino acids abstracted from 148'048 references.
 </p>
 <p>
  19'061 sequences have been added since release 50.0, the sequence data of
     1'336 existing entries has been updated and the annotations of
     222'181 entries have been revised.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many improvements were carried out in the last 5 months:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   We have changed the format of the ID line, replacing the terms
   <em>
    STANDARD/PRELIMINARY
   </em>
   by
   <em>
    Reviewed/Unreviewed
   </em>
   , and removing the
        legacy field
   <em>
    MoleculeType
   </em>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   We have also standardized the FASTA header lines of UniProtKB and UniRef entries.
  </li>
  <li>
   Cross-references to five new databases have been added, and the
        cross-references to Gene Ontology (GO) have been modified to
        include the source database for the mapping.
  </li>
  <li>
   There are two new
   <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/docs">
    documents
   </a>
   :
   <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/docs/rice">
    Index of Oryza sativa entries and their corresponding gene designations
   </a>
   ,          and
   <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/docs/nameprot">

   </a>

 <h3>
  ID (IDentification) line
 </h3>
 <p>
  The format of the ID line was:
 </p>
 <pre>
ID   EntryName DataClass; MoleculeType; SequenceLength.
</pre>
 <p>
  We have changed the values of the
  <code>
   DataClass
  </code>
  field
    as described in this table:
 </p>
 <table>
  <tr>
   <th>
    Old
    <code>

   <th>

  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    <code>
     STANDARD
    </code>
   </td>
   <td>
    <code>
     Reviewed
    </code>
   </td>
   <td>
    Entries that have been manually reviewed and annotated by
      UniProtKB curators (Swiss-Prot section of the UniProt Knowledgebase).
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    <code>
     PRELIMINARY
    </code>
   </td>
   <td>
    <code>
     Unreviewed
    </code>
   </td>
   <td>
    Computer-annotated entries that have not been reviewed
      by UniProtKB curators (TrEMBL section of the UniProt Knowledgebase).
   </td>
  </tr>
 </table>
 <p>
  We have also dropped the field
  <code>
   MoleculeType
  </code>
  ,
    which was a legacy of compatibility with the EMBL flat file
    format. The new format of the ID line is:
 </p>
 <pre>
ID   EntryName DataClass; SequenceLength.
</pre>
 <p>
  Examples:
 </p>
 <pre>
ID   CYC_PIG                 Reviewed;         104 AA.
</pre>
 <pre>
ID   Q3ASY8_CHLCH            Unreviewed;     36805 AA.
</pre>
 <h3>
  FASTA header line
 </h3>
 <p>
  We have standardized the FASTA header line of UniProtKB and
    UniRef entries in the following way:
 </p>
 <p>
  Format for UniProtKB
 </p>
 <pre>
&gt;UniqueIdentifier|EntryName ProteinName - OrganismName
</pre>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <code>
    UniqueIdentifier
   </code>
   is the primary accession
     number of the UniProtKB entry, or, in the case of entries that
     describe several protein isoforms, an isoform identifier.
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    EntryName
   </code>
   is the entry name of the UniProtKB
     entry.
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    ProteinName
   </code>
   is the recommended or submitted
     protein name of the UniProtKB entry. (This is the name before
     the first bracket, excluding 'precursor' but including 'Fragment'
     if appropriate - see the
   <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/manual/protein_names">
    Protein
     name documentation
   </a>
   .)
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    OrganismName
   </code>
   is the scientific name of the
     organism of the UniProtKB entry.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Examples:
 </p>
 <pre>
&gt;P24856|ANP_NOTCO Ice-structuring glycoprotein (Fragment) - Notothenia coriiceps neglecta
</pre>
 <pre>
&gt;P51650-1|SSDH_RAT Succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase - Rattus norvegicus
</pre>
 <h3>
  Cross-references to Human Protein Atlas
 </h3>
 <p>
  Cross-references have been added to the
  <a href="http://www.proteinatlas.org/">
   Human Protein Atlas
  </a>
  . The
  Human Protein Atlas shows the expression and localization of proteins
  in a large variety of normal human tissues and cancer cells. The data
  is presented as high resolution images representing immunohistochemically
  stained tissue sections. Each antibody in the database has been used
  for immunohistochemical staining of both normal and cancer tissue.
  The immunohistochemical protocols used result in a brown-black staining,
  localized where an antibody has bound to its corresponding antigen.

 <h3>
  Cross-references to Gene Ontology (GO)
 </h3>
 <p>
  The last field of the cross-references to the
  <a href="http://www.geneontology.org/">
   Gene Ontology (GO)
  </a>
  database has been modified. This field displays the
  <a href="http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml">
   GO evidence code
  </a>
  and we have appended to this the source database from which the
  cross-reference was obtained, separated by a colon.
