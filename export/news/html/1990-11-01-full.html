2  DATA SOURCES

Release 16.0 has been updated using protein sequence data from release  25.0  of
the  PIR  (Protein  Identification  Resource)  protein  data  bank,  as  well as
translation of nucleotide sequence data from release 24.0 of the EMBL Nucleotide
Sequence Data Library.

As an indication to the source of the sequence data in the SWISS-PROT data  bank
we  list  here  the  statistics  concerning  the DR (Databank Reference) pointer
lines:

   Entries with pointer(s) to only PIR entri(es):            3335
   Entries with pointer(s) to only EMBL entri(es):           5468
   Entries with pointer(s) to both EMBL and PIR entri(es):   8908
   Entries with no pointers lines:                            653



3  CHANGES AT THIS RELEASE

3.1  Cross-References To MIM

We have finished adding cross-references to all human protein  sequence  entries
which are represented in the latest edition of the MIM (Mendelian Inheritance in
Man) book [1].

There are currently 842 SWISS-PROT entries that have cross-references to one  or
more MIM catalog number.

A new document file, called MIMTOSP.DOC, is provided with SWISS-PROT,  it  is  a
sorted  list  of the MIM catalog entries cross-referenced in SWISS- PROT and the
corresponding protein sequence entry names.



4  FORTHCOMING CHANGES

We plan to implement the following changes in release  18  (these  changes  were
announced for release 16, but we are postponing their application so as to leave
more time to sequence analysis software developers to update their packages).



4.1  New Linetypes:  CA and CF

As we announced in the last release notes, the enzyme  entries  in  SWISS-  PROT
will have two new line-types:

      CA   Description_of_catalytic_activity.
      CF   Description_of_cofactor.

These lines will be automatically generated at each release of SWISS- PROT  from
the  information  stored  in  the  ENZYME  data  bank.   They  will  replace the
'CATALYTIC ACTIVITY` and 'COFACTORS` comment lines (CC) topics.  For example:

      CC   -!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-ASPARTATE + 2-OXOGLUTARATE =
               OXALOACETATE + L-GLUTAMATE.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1)  McKusick Victor A., Mendelian Inheritance in Man, Catalogs of autosomal
     dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked phenotypes, Ninth edition,
     Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, (1990).


      CC   -!- COFACTOR: PYRIDOXAL PHOSPHATE.

will be changed to:

      CA   L-ASPARTATE + 2-OXOGLUTARATE = OXALOACETATE + L-GLUTAMATE.
      CF   PYRIDOXAL PHOSPHATE.



4.2  OS Line Format

We will invert the order of the information in the OS line.  Currently  we  have
"English  common  name  (Latin  name)";  we  will switch to "Latin name (English
common name)".  For example:

     OS   HUMAN (HOMO SAPIENS).

will be changed to:

     OS   HOMO SAPIENS (HUMAN).



5  ENZYME AND PROSITE DATABASES

Release 3.0 of the ENZYME data bank is distributed  along  with  release  16  of
SWISS-PROT.   ENZYME  release  3.0  contains information relative to 3071 enzyme
entries.  The  data  bank  is  complete  and  up  to  date.   Until  new  enzyme
nomenclature  data  is published we only plan to update the SWISS- PROT pointers
at each release of the protein sequence data bank, correct eventual errors,  and
complete the information concerning synonyms and cofactors using the literature.

Release 6.0 of the PROSITE data bank is distributed along  with  release  16  of
SWISS-PROT.  PROSITE release 6 contains 375 documentation chapters that describe
433 different patterns.  Since release 5.1 77 new chapters have been  added  and
131 have been updated.



6  DISTRIBUTION MEDIA

Data is available on magnetic tape, TK50 cassette and CD-ROM.  This  section  of
the  release  notes  applies to tape and TK50 cassette only; CD-ROM releases are
accompanied by their own release notes which detail the file  organisation  used
on CD.



6.1  Tape Formats

The distribution tapes are 9-track industry standard magnetic tapes.  Each  file
consists  of  fixed-length  80  byte  records,  padded  with  trailing blanks as
appropriate (except for VMS Backup  format  tapes  which  have  variable  length
records).   Tape  format details (density, blocksize, label type, character set)
are attached to each tape.

In many formats, a release requires more than one  tape  volume.   In  order  to
support  sequential volume serial numbers for multi-volume tape sets, the volume
labels are EMBL01 for the first tape, EMBL02 for the second tape, and so on.

VMS Backup format tapes (and all TK50 cassettes) contain the files listed below,
in the order shown, as a single save set called SWISS15.BCK.



6.2  Documentation

The documentation files on tape (those ending with a file extension of .DOC) are
designed to be easily printable.  As with all other tape files they have a fixed
record length of 80 bytes.  The page length of 63 lines per page was  chosen  so
that the pages will fit both on DIN A4 paper and on American 8-1/2" x 11" paper.

Page throws are indicated by lines with  the  six  character  string  &lt;PAGE&gt;  in
positions  1-6,  and  nothing  else.  If you wish to print any of these files we
suggest you copy them down onto disk, use your local  editor  to  replace  every
occurrence of &lt;PAGE&gt; in columns 1-6 by a formfeed (or whatever is appropriate to
force a page throw on your printer), and then print them.



6.3  Release 16 Files

The distribution tape(s) contain the files shown below,  in  the  order  listed.
Where more than one tape is required, subsequent volumes will continue where the
preceding volume left off.

   File Number    File Name       Description                      #Records

7  INDEX FILE FORMATS

The index key of each index file (keywords, authors, citations, etc.) is  sorted
alphabetically;  the  names  of  all entries containing the index key are listed
alphabetically after the key.  Each entry name is  accompanied  by  its  primary
accession number.

Except for the short directory, accession number and species  id  code  indices,
all  index  files have the same layout:  each value of the index key begins on a
new line in column 1, and the associated entry names begin  on  the  next  line.
Lines containing entry names are in fixed-format, layed out as follows:

                     Columns   Description
                     -------   ---------------------------
                     14-23     entry name (left-justified)
                     29-34     primary accession number

                     36-45     entry name (left-justified)
                     51-56     primary accession number

                     58-67     entry name (left-justified)
                     73-78     primary accession number


Up to three entry names fit on each such line; if a given  index  key  has  more
than  three  entries associated with it, additional lines are used (with exactly
the same layout).  This index file format is  identical  to  that  of  the  EMBL
Nucleotide Sequence database.



7.1  Species Index

This file lists all  species  which  appear  in  the  database.   It  is  sorted
alphabetically  on  (english)  common name.  The latin genus and species will be
listed, if present in  the  database  entries.   Mitochondrion  and  chloroplast
sequences  appear  under  separate  index  keys,  immediately  after the related
nuclear sequences.  An excerpt from the species index file is given  below  (the
ruler is presented for your convenience - it does not appear in the index file):

7.3  Author Index

This file lists all author names which appear in citations (on the RA lines)  in
the database.  It is sorted alphabetically on name.  Names are presented as they
appear in the database entries (i.e.  as cited in  publications)  -  we  do  not
attempt  to  handle  multiple  surname spellings, or different initials, for the
same author.  An excerpt from the author index file is given below (the ruler is
presented for your convenience - it does not appear in the index file):

7.4  Short Directory Index

This file contains summary  information  about  all  entries  in  the  database,
including  a  brief description of the entry, its sequence length, molecule type
and data management class.  The file is sorted  alphabetically  on  entry  name.
The lines are fixed-format, layed out as follows:


     Columns   Field Name          Description
     -------   ---------------     -------------------------------------------
     01-10     entry name          left-justified

     20-25     sequence length     right-justified
     27-80     description         left-justified


If an entry's description occupies more than 54 characters (cols 27-80), it will
be  continued  onto  one or more continuation lines.  Continuation lines contain
description text (left-justified) in cols  27-80;  cols  01-26  are  blank.   An
excerpt  from  the  short  description  index  file is given below (the ruler is

This  file  lists  all  accession  numbers  in  the  database.   It  is   sorted
alphabetically  on  accession  number.  Each accession number is followed by the
name and primary accession number of every entry in which it occurs.

The lines are fixed-format, layed out exactly the same as the other index files;
the only difference is that the index key (accession number) appears on the same
line (in cols 1-6) as the list of entries which contain the key.  In  the  other
index  files,  the  index  key  appears  on  a  line by itself.  This index key,
however, is short enough to fit on the same line as the  entries,  and  we  have
done this to save space.

Accession numbers which have been deleted from the database also appear in  this
index, containing the word DELETED (left-justified) in the entry name field.

An excerpt from the accession number index file is given  below  (the  ruler  is
presented for your convenience - it does not appear in the index file):

7.7  Species ID Code Index

This file lists all species id codes which appear in the database.  It is sorted
alphabetically  on species id code.  Each code is followed by a (sorted) list of
all sequence entry codes which are associated with the  species  id  code.   The
sequence  entry  code is the first component of each entry name (before the "$")
and the species id code is the second component of each entry  name  (after  the
"$").   For  example, the entry called COA3$ADEA2 has a species id code of ADEA2
and a sequence entry code of COA3.

Each species id code starts on a  new  line,  occupying  columns  1-5,  and  the
associated  sequence entry codes (each up to 4 characters long) start in columns
10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, ...  70, 75.  If there are more than 14  sequence  entry
codes  for  a  given species id, as many continuation lines as necessary will be
used, with columns 1-9 left blank.

An excerpt from the species id code index file is  given  below  (the  ruler  is
presented for your convenience - it does not appear in the index file):

8  WE NEED YOUR HELP !

We welcome  any  feedback  from  our  users.   We  would  especially  appreciate
information  about  any sequences belonging to your field of expertise which are
missing from the database.  We also would like to be notified about  annotations
which  should be updated (e.g.  if the function of a protein has been clarified,
or if new post-translational information has become available).
