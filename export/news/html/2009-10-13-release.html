  Trichophyton tonsurans: an uninvited guest at the World Judo Championships
 </h3>
 <p>
  The World Judo Championships 2009 took place few weeks ago in Rotterdam, Netherlands. A
      sword of Damocles was hanging over this competition. Its name:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/34387">
   <em>
    Trichophyton tonsurans
   </em>
  </a>
  ,
      a fungal parasite.
  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16546582,18689970?report=DocSum">
   Japanese academics
  </a>
  have raised the alarm: the national sports of sumo and judo may decline because of the rapid spread
      of this skin-eating fungus. The infection is similar to athlete's foot. It is highly infectious and
      difficult to treat. It causes itchy
      red patches on the neck, face and upper body. It often affects the scalp and eventually attacks hair
      follicles, causing baldness. This distribution is consistent with areas of
      contact during the grappling that is at the heart of sumo and judo sports, suggesting that the fungus
      spreads by direct skin-to-skin contact.
 </p>
 <p>
  Trichophyton tonsurans is just one member of a large family of fungal parasites, called
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatophyte">
   dermatophytes
  </a>
  . Dermatophytes are not
      opportunists, but true pathogens that infect
      nonliving, cornified layers of the skin, hair and nail in warm and moist environments
      suitable for proliferation. They are the most common agents of superficial
      mycoses.
 </p>
 <p>
  The virulence of dermatophytes is largely due to the secretion of many different
      proteolytic enzymes. Their genomes encode dozens of secreted proteases.
      To improve the digestion efficiency of infected tissues, the pathogens secrete
      proteolytic "cocktails" composed of endo- and exoproteases.
 </p>
 <p>
  During keratin degradation and digestion, dermatophytes also excrete sulphite through an efflux pump
      (
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy:Arthrodermataceae+AND+gene:SSU1">
   SSU1
  </a>
  ).
      Sulphite reduces cystines, which are abundant in keratins, into cysteine and S-sulphocysteine. As a result, the
      proteins become more prone to hydrolysis by the secreted "protease cocktail".
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy:Arthrodermataceae+AND+gene:SSU1">
   SSU1
  </a>
  may also play an additional role.
      Indeed, living in a cyst(e)ine-rich environment, such as the epidermal stratum corneum, hair and nails,
      may have the fatal drawback of sulphur toxicity. Thus, by excreting excess sulphur as sulphate and
      sulphite, the pump may also protect dermatophytes from poisoning.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two large families of secreted endoproteases have been identified in dermatophytes: the
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy:arthrodermataceae+AND+name:subtilisin+like+protease+AND+reviewed:yes">
   subtilisin-like endoproteases
  </a>
  SUB1 through SUB7 and the metalloproteinases, also
      called
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=name:fungalysin+AND+reviewed:yes">
   fungalysins
  </a>
  .
      The exoproteases comprise dipeptidylpeptidases, such as
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy:arthrodermataceae+AND+gene:DPP4+AND+reviewed:yes">
   DPP4

   DPP5
  </a>
  ,
      aminopeptidases, such as
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy:arthrodermataceae+AND+gene:LAP1+AND+reviewed:yes">
   LAP1
  </a>
  and
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy:arthrodermataceae+AND+gene:LAP2+AND+reviewed:yes">
   LAP2
  </a>
  ,
      as well as carboxypeptidases, such as
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy:arthrodermataceae+AND+gene:MCPA+AND+reviewed:yes">
   MCPA
  </a>
  ,

  and
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy:arthrodermataceae+AND+gene:SCPB+AND+reviewed:yes">

  Dermatophytes are fascinating examples of evolutionary adaptation. These fungi have developed
      sophisticated weapons at our expense to achieve their goal: survival. Like David against Goliath, they
      have a good probability of winning the battle and
