  Human polymorphisms: juggling with health and disease
 </h3>
 <p>
  Recent advances in genomics and proteomics promise to give new
    insights into the molecular mechanisms of diseases and hopefully
    will lead to the discovery of novel treatments. The integration of
    phenotype descriptions along with sequence data, genetic information,
    as well as physiological, biochemical and structural knowledge may
    help understand the chain of events leading from a molecular defect
    to a pathology. In this context, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot provides the
    scientific community with a wealth of information on genetic diseases,
    disease-linked variants and polymorphisms.

  In the current release, over
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=topic:disease+organism:9606">
   2,000
  </a>
  human
    entries contain a disease description in the comment section under
    the topic "involvement in disease". The disease description is short,
    but it is supplemented with links to the
  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=OMIM">
   OMIM
  </a>
  database, allowing the retrieval of more detailed information about
    genetic disorders. Additional links to gene-specific databases can
    be found under
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P04637#section_web">
   web resources
  </a>
  .

  At the sequence level, close to 28,500 human single amino acid
    polymorphisms (SAPs) are described, more than half of which are
    associated with a disease state and about 30% are linked to the
    Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database (dbSNP). SAPs are described
    in the feature table and characterized by a unique identifier (FTId),
    which gives access to the variant web pages. These pages display a
    synopsis of relevant information for a given variant, including
    references, sequence context, as well as residue conservation
    throughout evolution and structural data, when available
    (
  <a href="http://expasy.org/cgi-bin/get-sprot-variant.pl?VAR_004939">

  </a>
  ).
    Mutations that cause major changes to a protein sequence (as is the
    case for most frameshift mutations) are not and will not be considered
    to be relevant to UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, as their deleterious effects
    on a given protein function is usually obvious.

 <p>
  Finally, our medical annotation effort also consists of the
    creation of keywords to allow easy
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=&amp;#38;by=keyword&amp;#38;parent=9995">
   retrieval of
    proteins involved in complex disorders and genetically
    heterogeneous diseases
  </a>
  .

 <p>
  Currently about
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-9995">
   100
  </a>
  "medical"
    keywords have been created, and the list is growing.
