  Spider dermonecrotic toxin family
 </h3>
 <p>
  Loxosceles is the genus of spiders that includes the infamous brown recluse
      spider
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/6921">
   Loxosceles reclusa
  </a>
  .
      These spiders, also called violin spiders or
     fiddleback spiders because of violin-like marks on their cephalothorax, are
     brownish-yellow in color, and spin small, irregular webs under rocks, or in
     nooks and crannies of your house. These spiders are found in the USA, South
     America, Europe and Africa. Their most characteristic feature is actually their
     eyes: most spiders have eight eyes, but Loxosceles have six, arranged in three
      pairs, or dyads, that sit side-by-side.

  The bite of a Loxosceles spider is not deadly, but it is very unpleasant - the
     venom is necrotoxic, causing tissue to die and fall off. Pain usually doesn't
     begin until 6-12 hours after the bite occurs. Loxosceles' necrotoxic venom is
     cytotoxic and hemolytic. It contains at least 8 enzymes; the enzyme thought to
     be responsible for most of the destructive effects is called Sphingomyelinase D.
     This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin and causes hemolysis and
      dermonecrosis.

  . This database is dedicated to the analysis of the
     genome of Mycobacterium ulcerans, the Buruli ulcer bacillus: BuruList. BuruList provides a
     complete dataset of DNA and protein sequences derived from the epidemic strain Agy99, linked
     to the relevant annotations and functional assignments. It allows one to easily browse through
     these data and retrieve information, using various criteria (gene names, location, keywords, etc.).
