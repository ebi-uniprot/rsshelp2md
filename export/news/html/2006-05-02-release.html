  5,000 rat entries in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot

  While in imperial China the rat was associated with creativity,
    honesty and generosity, western culture tends to see them as vicious,
    unclean, parasitic animals that steal food and spread disease.
    Whatever your feelings towards this small rodent are, for modern
    biologists rats have proved to be a good animal model for many
    human diseases, such as diabetes, arthritis and cardiovascular diseases.
    Despite its importance for medical research and although its genome
    sequence has been published in 2004, the amount of sequence data
    available is still much smaller than for the other two best
    studied mammals, namely human and mouse. The number of
  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST/dbEST_summary.html">
   rat
    ESTs at the NCBI
  </a>
  is only 11% of that of human and 18% of that
    of mouse. Not many high-throughput cDNA sequencing projects have
    been initiated and, in the
  <a href="http://mgc.nci.nih.gov/">
   NIH
    Mammalian Gene Collection
  </a>
  , rat sequences represent less than
    one quarter of human ones. As a result, this trend is also observed
    in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, which is highly dependent upon submissions
    of sequence data to the public DNA sequence databases EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ.
    In UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, rat is the third best represented mammal,
    after human and mouse. With more than

  ,
    it is still underrepresented compared to human and mouse. However,
    new rat entries are continuously integrated in order to represent
    all mammalian orthologs of human proteins. Our final aim is to
    provide our users with a complete set of rat proteins.
