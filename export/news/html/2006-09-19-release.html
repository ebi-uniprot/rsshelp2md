  The search for the origin of HIV-1
 </h3>
 <p>
  The origin of
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/11676">
   Human immunodeficiency
    virus 1
  </a>
  (HIV-1) has been the subject of hot debate for more
    than twenty years. In 1999, American, Japanese and French
    researchers claimed to have discovered an indisputable link
    between a chimpanzee virus from central West Africa called
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/388910">
   SIVcpz
  </a>
  (Simian Immunodeficiency
    Virus from chimpanzees) and HIV-1. SIVcpz is 70-90% identical to
    HIV-1 and does not appear to cause illness in chimpanzees.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, since SIVcpz was only found in a few chimpanzees
    held in captivity, the possibility existed that another yet
    unidentified species could be the natural reservoir of both
    HIV-1 and SIVcpz.
 </p>
 <p>
  A
  <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1126531">
   recent
    study
  </a>
  provides for the first time a clear picture of the
    origin of HIV-1 and the seeds of the AIDS pandemic. New strains
    of SIVcpz have been identified in wild chimpanzees from Cameroon.
    These new strains are more closely related to human HIV-1 than
    to any Simian viruses.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are three HIV-1 lineages: M (Major), O (Outlier) and N
    (New). The new SIVcpz isolate MB66 turned out to be more closely
    related to HIV-1 group M than to any Simian virus
    (see a
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/blast/?query=Q1A267">
   similarity search for
    SIVcpz MB66 gag-pol protein
  </a>
  ). Moreover, another wild virus,
    SIVcpz isolate EK505, is very closely related to HIV-1 group N.
    This suggests that at least two independent SIVcpz transfers from
    chimpanzee to man occurred in this region. HIV-1 group M
    presumably crossed species early in the 20th century. HIV-1 group
    N may have infected humans more recently.
 </p>
 <p>
  The authors of the study also postulate that "given the
    extensive genetic diversity and phylogeographical clustering of
    SIVcpz now recognised and the vast areas of west central Africa
    not yet sampled, it is quite possible that still other SIVcpz
    lineages exist that could pose risks for human infection and
    prove problematic for HIV diagnostics and vaccines."

    cellular processes and organism behaviors from genomic and molecular information.
