  The plastid: the most important organelle!
 </h3>
 <p>
  The world is full of plastids. Most of us know the green photosynthetic
      chloroplast which houses the machinery that fixes CO
  <sub>
   2
  </sub>
  (with O
  <sub>
   2
  </sub>
  as a "mere"
      by-product) and synthesizes sugars, lipids, amino acids, etc.; in short, the basis
      of our food chain. Found in plants and algae, chloroplasts are absolutely
      essential to life as we know it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Plastids contain DNA; they are the remnants of a cyanobacterium that was
      engulfed by a eukaryotic heterotroph which had previously engulfed an
      alphaproteobacteria which eventually became the mitochondrion. These are
      primary endosymbiotic events; the organism that was taken up by the host was
      not digested but survived in the cytoplasm, eventually transferring genes to
      the host nucleus and being in effect enslaved. Most of these transferred gene
      products are imported back into their respective organelles using transit
      peptides. Plastids now encode between 28 and 250 protein-coding genes. The
      primary plastid endosymbiosis gave rise to 3 lineages: green algae, red algae
      and the glaucophytes. Subsequent engulfment of green or red algae by other
      eukaryotes has given rise to secondary endosymbionts, which in some cases have
      been engulfed again, sometimes with plastid replacement, to give an array of
      tertiary endosymbionts. These secondary and tertiary events gave rise to (among
      others) cryptophytes, diatoms, heterokont algae and apicocomplexa which are organisms
      that are no longer photosynthetic such as Plasmodium. To further complicate
      matters, it was thought that there were only 2 primary endosymbiotic events;
  <a href="http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18356055">
   recent work
  </a>
  , however,
      on a thecate amoeba, Paulinella chromatophora, has cast doubt on this assumption.
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to their small size, plastids are easily sequenced. A list of fully sequenced
      plastid genomes, their genes and the nomenclature of known plastid-encoded
      proteins can be found in our document
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/docs/plastid">
   plastid.txt
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  In UniProtKB, we indicate whether a protein is encoded by plastid,
      mitochondrial or plasmid DNA in the 'Names and origin' section,
      'Encoded on' subsection (OG line in the flat file). 6 categories have been created for
      plastids:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   'Plastid; Chloroplast' indicates the organism is photosynthetic,
       whether of primary, secondary or higher endosymbiotic events.
  </li>
  <li>
   'Plastid; Non-photosynthetic plastid' is used when the organism is
       from a photosynthetic lineage but genetically unable to photosynthesize, as
       happens with some parasitic plants (Epifagus virginiana, Aneura mirabilis), a
       parastic "green" algae (Helicosporidium sp. subsp. Simulium jonesii) and a
       euglenoid (Astasia longa).
  </li>
  <li>
   'Plastid; Cyanelle' is used for the plastid of the glaucophyte algae. It has the
       remnants of a cell wall between its surrounding membranes.
  </li>
  <li>
   'Plastid; Apicoplast' is used for plastids from the non-photosynthetic
       Apicocomplexan parasites such as Plasmodium, Toxoplasma and Eimeria which cause
       malaria, toxoplasmosis and coccidian diseases respectively. Although the
       plastid remnant has a reduced coding capacity, it is essential for cell
       survival and is interesting as a drug target.
  </li>
  <li>
   'Plastid; Chromatophore' is used for the plastid of the thecate amoeba
       Paulinella chromatophora, which has a very large endosymbiont genome (1.0 Mb,
       encoding almost 900 proteins).
  </li>
  <li>
   'Plastid' (without any qualifier) is used for some parasitic plants
      (mostly from the genus Cuscuta) which may be briefly photosynthetic when very young.
  </li>
 </ul>

  New UniParc query field 'isoform'
 </h3>
 <p>
  The existing query field
  <code>
   uniprot
  </code>
  allows you to search UniParc for the
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/canonical_and_isoforms">
   canonical sequence
  </a>
  of a UniProtKB entry, e.g.
  <code>
   <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniparc/?query=uniprot:P00750">
    uniprot:P00750
   </a>
  </code>
  .

     With the new query field
  <code>
   isoform
  </code>
  you can retrieve the UniParc record that
     corresponds to the sequence of a specific UniProtKB isoform, e.g.
  <code>
   <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniparc/?query=isoform:P00750-2">
    isoform:P00750-2
   </a>
  </code>
  or you can retrieve all isoforms of a UniProtKB entry, e.g.
  <code>
   <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniparc/?query=isoform:P00750-*">
    isoform:P00750-*
   </a>
  </code>
