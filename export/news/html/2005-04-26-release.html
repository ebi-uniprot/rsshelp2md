  1 million cysteine residues in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
 </h3>
 <p>
  The total number of cysteine residues in Swiss-Prot has reached the 1 million
     mark. While there is nothing special about this number, we thought it was
     interesting in the context of the natural bias in the amino composition of
     proteins. There is more than a 8-fold difference between the frequency of the rarest
     amino acid (tryprophan at 1.15%) and that of the most frequent one (leucine
     at 9.64%). There are a number of reasons for this compositional bias, one of which
     is the degeneracy of the genetic code (which allows from 1 to 6 different
     triplets to code for a specific amino acid), and another one is the prevalence
     of hydrophobic aliphatic residues such as leucine or isoleucine in transmembrane
      domains and in signal sequences.

  New Swiss-Prot document: pathway.txt
 </h3>
 <p>
  The new Swiss-Prot document
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/docs/pathway">
   pathway.txt
  </a>
  includes an index of
CC PATHWAY lines. For each step of an
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/manual/pathway">
   annotated pathway
  </a>
  ,
a list of Swiss-Prot entries is given that are annotated to participate in that pathway.

  Change in cross-references MGI (former MGD)
 </h3>
 <p>
  <a href="http://www.informatics.jax.org">
   Mouse Genome Informatics
  </a>
  have asked us to use the acronym MGI in our cross-references to the Mouse Genome Database, which we used to refer to as "MGD".
We changed the database name in the relevant cross-references (DR lines) accordingly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Example:
 </p>
 <pre>AC   P07724;
DR   MGI; MGI:87991; Alb1..</pre>
 <br/>
 The
 <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/docs/mgdtosp">
  Index of MGD entries referenced in Swiss-Prot
 </a>
 (mgdtosp.txt) keeps its name, and so does the
    "
 <a href="ftp://ftp.expasy.org/databases/swiss-prot/special_selections/mgd.seq.gz">
  special selections file
 </a>
 "
    (mgd.seq.gz) containing all entries with "DR  MGI" lines.
