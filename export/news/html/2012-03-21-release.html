  The importance of being manual
 </h3>
 <p>
  Manual annotation is a time-consuming and expensive process, but undoubtedly adds great value to knowledgebases like UniProtKB. A recent and
  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22076378">
   very elegant study on sirtuin-5
  </a>
  illustrates how new functions continue to be discovered within what are thought to be well characterized protein families. Curating this information facilitates its dissemination as well as its subsequent (re)use in automatic annotation and function prediction systems.

 <p>
  Sirtuins, also called Sir2 proteins, are
  <span class="caps">
   NAD
  </span>
  -dependent deacetylases that regulate important biological processes. The name ‘Sir2’ comes from the
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P06700">
   yeast ‘silent information regulation 2’
  </a>
  gene, a gene involved among others in transcriptional repression. Sirtuins belong to a
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=family:%22sirtuin+family%22+reviewed:yes">
   family of evolutionally conserved proteins
  </a>
  occurring in all kingdoms. Mammals have

  <span class="caps">
   SIRT4

  have been shown to have only a very weak deacetylase activity, if any. While this could be due to an inappropriate choice of peptides for the analysis, it could also be envisioned that their physiological activity is different.

 <p>
  A major breakthrough in the field came from the study of
  <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=3RIY">
   <span class="caps">
    SIRT5
   </span>
   crystal structure
  </a>
  . It appeared that the pocket used by
  <span class="caps">
   SIRT2
  </span>
  to host acetyl groups was much larger in
  <span class="caps">
   SIRT5
  </span>
  , large enough to host a negatively charged acyl group instead. The most common acyl-CoA molecules with a carboxylate group in cells are malonyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA. Hence, malonyl-and succinyl-peptides were produced and tested as substrates for

  was actually able to catalyze their hydrolysis, proving it is a desuccinylase and a demalonylase, rather than a deacetylase. This discovery raised another question: do such post-translational modifications (PTMs) exist at all? Lysine succinylation has been shown on

   <em>

  The presence of these PTMs was investigated in mitochondria, the organelle hosting
