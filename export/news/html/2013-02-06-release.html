  Although marijuana has been used for centuries, the biological processes underlying its psychoactive effects have long remained a mystery. It is only recently that the cannabinoid biosynthetic pathway has been elucidated. The production of
  <em>
   Cannabis
  </em>
  ’ major psychoactive ingredient, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), starts with the condensation of hexanoyl-CoA with three molecules of malonyl-CoA to yield olivetolic acid (OA). It was postulated that a type
  <span class="caps">
   III
  </span>
  polyketide synthase was catalyzing this reaction, although all type
  <span class="caps">
   III
  </span>
  PKSs from
  <em>

  </em>
  characterized so far were only able to produce byproducts instead of OA.
