  Dioxygenases: from antigenic variation to myeloid malignacies

  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8261512">
   Beta-D-glucopyranosyloxymethyluracil
  </a>
  , also called base J, was the first hypermodified base
      to be identified in eukaryotic DNA, in 1993, in the nucleus of
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanosoma_brucei">
   <em>
    Trypanosoma brucei
   </em>
  </a>
  . Base J is shown to
      be present in all kinetoplastids analyzed, in the related marine flagellate
  <em>
   Diplonema
  </em>
  and in
  <em>
   Euglena gracilis
  </em>
  , a unicellular alga closely related to
      the
  <em>
   Kinetoplastida
  </em>
  (see
  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18729733?report=DocSum">
   review
  </a>
  ). Base J was not only absent in a
      variety of other protozoa, fungi and vertebrates, but most organisms lacking base J
      contain DNA glycosylases attacking hydroxymethyldeoxyuridine (HOMedU), thus actively
      preventing the appearance of this intermediate of base J synthesis. Mammals even contain a
      highly active dedicated
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=key%3Asmug1_*">
   HOMedU glycosylase
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The biosynthesis of base J has been characterized. It requires 2 dioxygenases:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=key%3AJBP1_*">
   JBP1
  </a>
  and
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=key%3AJBP2_*">
   JBP2
  </a>
  . But the precise function of this DNA modification is not clear. It
      seems to play a role in
  <em>
   Trypanosoma
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   Leishmania
  </em>
  antigenic variation. It was first suspected
      to be involved in gene silencing, but this hypothesis lacks support. A current idea is
      that it may regulate homologous recombination at telomeres where most genes encoding Variant
      Surface Glycoproteins (VSG) are located.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the existence of such a complex DNA modification seemed
      unlikely in vertebrates,
  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19372391">
   Tahiliani et
       al.

  (2009) performed a computational search and found JBP homologs throughout
      metazoans, including man where 3 homologs -

   TET1

  ,
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q6N021">
   TET2
  </a>
  ,
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/O43151">
   TET3
  </a>
  - were identified.
      Human TET1 was unambiguously shown to be able to catalyze the conversion from 5-methylcytosine to
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-hydroxymethylcytosine">
   5-hydroxymethylcytosine
  </a>
  (hmC).
      Was it just a pure exercise in style? Actually not. HmC is present in mouse embryonic stem cells. Moreover
      it appears to be quite abundant in mouse brain, where it constitutes up to 0.6% of total
      nucleotides in Purkinje cells and 0.2% in granule cells (
  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19372393">
   Kriaucionis and Heintz, 2009
  </a>
  ).
 </p>
 <p>
  Human TET1 has been known since 2002 to be involved in some acute leukemias, where it plays
      the role of the fusion partner of
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q03164">
   MLL
  </a>
  in the translocation t(10;11)(q22;q23) (
  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.        gov/pubmed/12124344">
   Ono et al., 2002
  </a>
  ). In the first months of 2009, several articles pointed at TET2
      mutations that contribute to pathogenesis of a wide spectrum of
  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.        nih.gov/pubmed/19483684,19474426,19372255,19295549,19262601,19262599,19420352">
   myeloid
       malignancies
  </a>
  , including myelodysplastic syndromes, myeloproliferative disorders, acute
      myeloid and chronic myelomonocytic leukemias.

  A new exciting area of investigation is now open to understand the physiological function of
      TET/JBP family members, which may be quite crucial in view of the dramatic consequences of their mutation.
      As of this release,
      the manually annotated protein sequences of these enzymes are available from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot:
