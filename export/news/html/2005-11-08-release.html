  A city-sized crowd of authors

 <p>
  UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot is a manually annotated protein knowledgebase. This involves not
only sequence curation, but also a critical review of the scientific
literature. All references used to create an entry are always cited,
whether they are complex publications or simple submissions. Currently,
there are more than
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/docs/jourlist">
   1'600 journals
  </a>
  referenced in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, and more than
210'000 distinct authors.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bringing all these authors together for a meeting would result
in a gathering of a size similar to that of
  <a href="http://www.ville-ge.ch/en/decouvrir/en-bref/index.htm">
   Geneva
  </a>
  ,
the city where
UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot was created and is still based... A small, Swiss city
with an international vocation, a little like UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, which began as a local
project of a graduate student with quite an ambitious aim: providing the scientific community throughout the world with a central hub for sharing biological knowledge.
To achieve this goal, the Swiss-Prot group very quickly developped a
strong and fruitful collaboration with the European Institute of Bioinformatics (EBI)
and more recently with the Protein Information Resource (PIR) of the
Georgetown University Medical Center in USA (
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/">
   http://www.uniprot.org/
  </a>
  ).
The Swiss-Prot group is not only international but also interdisciplinary. Various
educational backgrounds are mixed: biologists, biochemists, programmers, mathematicians,
wet lab experts or students, etc. This team work is what ensures the quality of the knowledgebase.
