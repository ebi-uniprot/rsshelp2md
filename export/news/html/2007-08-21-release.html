  Over 18,500 phosphorylation sites identified by mass spectrometry in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
 </h3>
 <p>
  Phosphorylation is a key reversible modification that regulates protein
      function, subcellular localization, stability, and interactions. It is believed
      that up to 30% of all eukaryotic proteins may be phosphorylated.
 </p>
 <p>
  During the last few years, phosphoproteomics have greatly improved due to
      the optimization of enrichment protocols for phosphoproteins and
      phosphopeptides, better fractionation techniques using chromatography, and
      improvement of mass spectrometry instrumentation. Thanks to these developments,
      it is now possible to analyze entire phosphorylation sets rapidly. However,
      protein and phosphorylation site identification by mass spectrometry is
      crucially dependent on the quality and completeness of the biological resource
      used for analysis.
 </p>
 <p>
  In UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, we make a special effort to document post-
      translational modifications and especially phosphorylation sites, using data
      from the literature. We have incorporated data from 38 high-quality phosphoproteomics studies
      which have allowed us to annotate or confirm 18,556 phosphorylation sites in
      6,493 protein entries, mainly from human (45%), mouse (27%) and yeast (25%),
      but also from rat,
  <em>
   Arabidopsis thaliana
  </em>
  and bacteria. These high-throughput studies can
      be easily recognized among other UniprotKB references through the [LARGE SCALE
      ANALYSIS] tag appearing in 'cited for' topic in the 'References' section (RP line in the flat file).
