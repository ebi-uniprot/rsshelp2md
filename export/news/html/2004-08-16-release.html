 <h3>
  New RL line structure for electronic publications
 </h3>
 <p>
  Electronic publications have been indicated in the RL line with the '(er)' prefix that
stands for electronic resource:
 </p>
 <pre>RL   <strong>(er)</strong> Free text.</pre>
 <p>
  Example:
 </p>
 <pre>RL   (er) Plant Gene Register PGR98-023.</pre>
 <h3>
  Removal of the submission references to HIV data bank
 </h3>
 <p>
  We replaced all submission references to the HIV data bank by publications, thus RL lines
of the type:
 </p>
 <pre>RL   Submitted (XXX-YYYY) to the HIV data bank.</pre>
 <p>
  <strong>
   do no longer exist
  </strong>
  in Swiss-Prot.

 <h3>
  Change in cross-references to PDB
 </h3>
 <p>
  The structure determination method (X-ray, NMR, etc) as well as
the mapping of the extent of the cross-reference on the sequence have been
introduced as tertiary identifier to the PDB cross-reference line.
 </p>
 <p>
  Former format:
 </p>
 <pre>DR   PDB; ENTRY_NAME; REVISION_DATE.</pre>
 <p>
  <strong>
   New format:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <pre><strong>DR   PDB; ENTRY_NAME; Method; CHAIN[S]=RANGE.</strong></pre>
 <p>
  The methods are controlled vocabulary and currently include:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   X-ray (for X-ray crystallography)
  </li>
  <li>
   NMR (for NMR spectroscopy)
  </li>
  <li>
   EM (for electron microscopy and cryo-electron diffraction)
  </li>
  <li>
   Fiber (for fiber diffraction)
  </li>
  <li>
   IR (for infrared spectroscopy)
  </li>
  <li>
   Model (for predicted models)
  </li>
  <li>
   Neutron (for neutron diffraction)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Example:
 </p>
 <pre>DR   PDB; 1NB3; X-ray; A/B/C/D=116-335, P/R/S/T=98-105.</pre>
 <p>
  The tertiary identifier indicates the chain(s) and the corresponding range, of which the structure
has been determined. If the range is unknown, a dash is given rather than the range positions. Example:
 </p>
 <pre>DR   PDB; 1IYJ; X-ray; <strong>B/D=-.</strong></pre>
 <p>
  If the chains and the range is unknown, a dash is used. Example:
 </p>
 <pre>DR   PDB; 1N12; X-ray; <strong>-</strong>.</pre>
 <p>
  With the introduction of the new format, DR PDB lines can become
  <strong>
   longer than 75 characters
  </strong>
  .
