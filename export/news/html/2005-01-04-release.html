 <h3>
  Extension of the Swiss-Prot entry name format
 </h3>
 <p>
  We endeavor to assign meaningful entry names that facilitate the
identification of the proteins and the species of origin. Swiss-Prot
uses a general purpose naming convention that can be symbolized as X_Y,
where X is a mnemonic code of alphanumeric characters representing
the protein name, the '_' sign serves as a separator, and the Y is a
mnemonic species identification code of at most 5 alphanumeric characters
representing the biological source of the protein.
 </p>
 <p>
  The entry name used to consist of up to ten uppercase alphanumeric characters.
We now elongated the
  <strong>
   mnemonic code for the protein name
  </strong>
  from up to 4 characters
to
  <strong>
   up to 5 characters
  </strong>
  , thus
  <strong>
   entry names can from now on consist of up to 11
characters
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  As this modification might have an impact on many programs, we introduced in
this release only one Swiss-Prot entry with an entry name in the new format:
  <strong>
   <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9W0Y1">
    TINA1_DROME
   </a>
  </strong>
  (Q9W0Y1).
With
  <strong>
   UniProtKB release 4.0
  </strong>
  at the beginning of February,
  <strong>
   we will change the entry
names of many Swiss-Prot entries
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  We strongly advise users to cite Swiss-Prot entries by their unique and stable
identifer, which is the first (primary)
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/manual/accession">
   accession number
  </a>
  of an entry.
It happens occasionally that entries are only referred to by the entry
name. As we will soon change the entry names of thousands of entries,
we provide the tool
  <a href="http://www.expasy.org/cgi-bin/idtracker">
   IDtracker
  </a>
  ,
which allows users of the Swiss-Prot protein knowledgebase to trace the
identifiers (ID) of protein entries.

  Cross-references to Ensembl

 <p>
  Cross-references have been added to the

   Ensembl database

  , a
bioinformatics project that organizes biological information around the sequences of
large genomes. Ensembl is available at
