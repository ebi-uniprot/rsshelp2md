  Transient pleasures of the mind
 </h3>
 <p>
  Symmetry and round objects, including round numbers, easily fascinate the
      human mind. Thus, UniProtKB is happy to announce that we have a double set of
      round numbers to celebrate: UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot now contains over 50'000
      cross-references to PDB and over
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=database:pdb+AND+taxonomy:mammalia+AND+reviewed:yes">
   5'000 mammalian entries
  </a>
  with experimental 3D-structures.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is deeply satisfactory to see the 3D-structure of a protein. 3D-structures show the
      interactions between proteins and other macromolecules, and
      between proteins and small ligands, such as metal ions, substrates and
      inhibitors. Determining the 3D-structure is an important step for elucidating
      the mode of action of a well-characterized protein, and it provides a starting
      point for the classification of an uncharacterized protein and the prediction
      of its physiological role.
 </p>
 <p>
  UniProtKB provides access to protein 3D-structures via cross-references to
      PDB (see for example
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P00734#section_x-ref">
   P00734
  </a>
  ). The number of structures is constantly increasing, and quite
      frequently several structures have been determined for a given protein.
      Thus, the 50'000 cross-references to PDB in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot correspond to more than
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=database:pdb+AND+reviewed:yes">
   12'700 individual
       entries
  </a>
  . Over 5'000 of these (about 40%) are from mammalian model organisms,
      including close to
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=database:pdb+AND+reviewed:yes+AND+taxonomy:9606">
   3'300 human entries
  </a>
  , while bacteria and archaea account for over
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=%28database%3Apdb+AND+reviewed%3Ayes%29+AND+%28taxonomy%3AArchaea+OR+taxonomy%3A%22Bacteria+%5B2%5D%22%29">
   4'500
  </a>
  of the entries with links to PDB. Escherichica coli strain K12 is currently the best studied organism at the structural level, with
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=database:pdb+AND+reviewed:yes+AND+taxonomy:K12">
   1035
  </a>
  out of its
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy%3A83333+AND+keyword%3A%22complete+proteome%22">
   4'339 proteins
  </a>
  (almost 25%) having at least one link to a PDB entry.
      Close to 6'000 additional links to PDB are in UniProtKB/TrEMBL, corresponding to another
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=database:pdb+AND+reviewed:no">
   3'500 entries
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to the efforts of individual laboratories and structural proteomics
      groups, the number of experimental 3D-structures is rapidly increasing, and so
      the symmetrical roundness of the present numbers is a very transient phenomenon.
      Soon for every new protein there may be a family member with an experimental
      3D-structure, even for membrane proteins. That is definitely
      something to look forward to.
