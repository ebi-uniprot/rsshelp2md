  All known human G protein-coupled receptor proteins in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
 </h3>
 <p>
  The Human Proteome Initiative (
  <a href="http://www.expasy.org/sprot/hpi/">
   HPI
  </a>
  )
      aims to annotate all known human protein sequences, as well as their mammalian orthologs.
      The G protein-coupled receptor proteins (GPCRs), also known as seven transmembrane
      receptors (7TM receptors) form one of the largest proteins family in mammalian genomes.
      These proteins are involved in all types of stimulus-response pathways, from intercellular
      communication to physiological senses, including taste, smell, and vision (opsins receptors).
      Many diseases are linked to GPCRs and half of the drug products by the pharmaceutical
      industry are targeted against GPCRs. A special emphasis has been given to
      this family in the HPI project.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the current release, all known and potential human G protein-coupled receptor protein
      are annotated and integrated in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.

   775 human GPCRs
  </a>
  are now available in our knowledgebase. About half of all GPCRs are presumed to be involved in the
      sense of smell. For the remaining half, the active ligand has been documented when
      available, but about 20% of human GPCRs are still orphans. Most of mouse and rat
      orthologs have been annotated.
 </p>
 <p>
  All G protein-coupled receptor proteins annotated in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot are
      classified by family and listed in the file

  Cross-references to Gene3D

 <p>
  Cross-references have been added to the
  <a href="http://cathwww.biochem.ucl.ac.uk:8080/Gene3D/">
   Gene3D Structural and Functional Annotation of Protein Families database
  </a>
  . Gene3D database provides a combined
     structural, functional and evolutionary view of the protein world. It is focussed on providing structural annotation
     for protein sequences without structural representatives -- including the complete proteomes of over 240 different
     species. The protein sequences have also been clustered into whole-chain families so as to aid functional prediction.
     The structural annotation is generated using HMM models based on the CATH domain families; CATH is a repository for
     manually deduced protein domains.
