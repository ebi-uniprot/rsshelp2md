  Complete set of Arabidopsis thaliana F-box proteins
 </h3>
 <p>
  F-box proteins play a major role in the ubiquitin conjugation pathway.
      There are involved in the third step of this pathway.
      Most of the F-box protein contains a conserved
  <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/IEntry?ac=IPR001810">
   F-box domain
  </a>
  near the N-terminus
      and a variable region.
      The F-box domain can interact with Cullin and one of the SKP1 proteins to form a
  <strong>
   E3 SCF (SKP1/Cullin/F-box) ubiquitin ligase complex
  </strong>
  . The variable region interacts with a
      specific protein, which is, in turn, ubiquitinated and thus targeted to protein degradation.
      This variable region confers the specificity of the SCF complex.

      has been
  <strong>
   manually reviewed and integrated into UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
  </strong>
  .
      About 120 wrong gene model predictions have been corrected, including 26 F-box proteins obtained
      by splitting erroneous gene predictions covering more than one gene.
      This represents one of the largest
      protein family of a given species that had ever been integrated into UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.
