  UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot major release (53.0)
 </h3>
 <p>
  Release 53.0 of 29-May-07 of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot contains 269'293 sequence
     entries, comprising 98'902758 amino acids abstracted from 156'204 references.
     9'228 sequences have been added since release 52.0: this represents a 3.5%
     increase. In addition, the sequence data of 734 existing entries have been
      updated and the annotations of 210'454 entries have been revised.
 </p>
 <p>
  The following improvements were carried out in the last 3 months:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   We have created a new comment subsection: SEQUENCE CAUTION. This
     subsection is used for all the comments related to submitted sequences which differ
     from the sequence shown in the entry because of conflicts, such as frameshifts,
     erroneous gene model predictions, erroneous translation or other discrepancies
     that cannot be described in the feature 'Conflict'.
  </li>
  <li>
   We have added cross-references to 3 new databases:
   <a href="http://genolist.pasteur.fr/BuruList/" shape="rect">
    BuruList
   </a>
   ,
       a database dedicated to the analysis of Mycobacterium
       ulcerans genome,
   <a href="http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/home.php?Lng=GB" shape="rect">
    Orphanet
   </a>
   ,
       a database dedicated to information on rare diseases and orphan drugs, and
   <a href="http://www.pseudomonas.com/" shape="rect">
    PseudoCAP
   </a>
   , a Pseudomonas genome database.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  UniProt Knowledgebase release 11.0 includes Swiss-Prot release 53.0 and TrEMBL
      release 36.0.
 </p>
 <p>
  We are pleased to announce a new UniProt
      database, the UniProt Metagenomic and Environmental Sequences
      (UniMES) database, a repository specifically developed for
      metagenomic and environmental data. UniMES is available in FASTA
      format on the UniProt ftp servers, in the new subdirectory
  <strong>
   current_release/unimes
  </strong>

 <h3>
  New comment subsection SEQUENCE CAUTION
 </h3>
 <p>
  We have introduced a new subsection in the General Annotation (Comments) section,
     SEQUENCE CAUTION, to describe protein sequence reports that differ from the sequence that is shown in
     UniProtKB due to conflicts that are not described in the SEQUENCE CONFLICT lines (Features),
     such as frameshifts,
     erroneous gene model predictions, etc. This kind of information was before
     reported in the topic CAUTION together with other warnings that are
     unrelated to sequence conflicts.
 </p>
 <p>
  The format of the SEQUENCE CAUTION topic is:
 </p>
 <pre>
     CC   -!- SEQUENCE CAUTION:
     Sequence=<em>Sequence</em>; Type=<em>Type</em>;[ Positions=<em>Positions</em>;][ Note=<em>Note</em>;]
    </pre>
 <p>
  Where:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <em>
    Sequence
   </em>
   is the sequence which differs from the UniProtKB sequence. It is described by one of:
   <ul>
    <li>
     an EMBL protein identifier (with version number)
    </li>
    <li>
     an EMBL accession number.
    </li>
    <li>
     a literature reference (e.g. Ref. 3).
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Type
   </em>
   describes the cause for the sequence difference(s) and is one of:
   <ul>
    <li>
     Frameshift
    </li>
    <li>
     Erroneous initiation
    </li>
    <li>
     Erroneous termination
    </li>
    <li>
     Erroneous gene model prediction
    </li>
    <li>
     Erroneous translation
    </li>
    <li>
     Miscellaneous discrepancy
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Positions
   </em>
   describes the UniProtKB sequence position(s) or range(s) of the difference(s) where possible. Sometimes the term 'Several' is used to indicate that there are many differences.
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Note
   </em>
   is an optional free text explanation.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  These lines are not wrapped and their length may therefore exceed 75 characters.
