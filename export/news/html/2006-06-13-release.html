  Man gave names to all the... proteins
 </h3>
 <p>
  We have spent many years curating all kinds of proteins from all kinds of
                species. One recurring challenge is to offer an easily searchable and
                consistent knowledgebase dealing, in particular, with many ambiguities and
                discrepancies regarding protein names. Nomenclature is not only indispensable
                for communication, but also for literature search and entry retrieval. We feel
                that our experience in this field can be valuable, and that we can play a role
                in helping the standardization of protein nomenclature.
 </p>
 <p>
  To take up this challenge, we created a
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/docs/nameprot">
   new document
  </a>
  which describes
  <strong>
   guidelines
  </strong>
  used by UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot annotators
  <strong>
   to give each
                entry the most appropriate name
  </strong>
  , called the "Recommended name" (RN). In short,
                an RN should follow the approved nomenclature, if it exists, and should be
                unique and attributed to all orthologs. Other rules deal mostly with the syntax
                of submitted protein names in order to have consistent and reproducible RNs in
                spite of the variability observed in various submissions. If our RN differs
                from the submitted one, the latter is kept as "alternative name". In this way
                we enhance the searchability, as well as the consistency, of our database.
 </p>
 <p>
  We sincerely hope that researchers will adhere as much as possible to these
                guidelines for naming new proteins when publishing or submitting their data.
                This will make their results easily searchable, allow tracking of a given
                protein across related organisms and help us in our continuing effort to
                standardize nomenclature.

  Protein naming guidelines
 </h3>
 <p>
  The document
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/docs/nameprot">
   nameprot.txt
  </a>
  lists a number of rules for naming proteins. UniProt is constantly
    striving to further standardize the nomenclature for a given protein
    across related organisms. In this context, we try to use these rules
    to attribute a recommended name to all the proteins of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.
    We also we hope that authors/laboratories will follow as much as
    possible these rules for naming new proteins.
