  Happy anniversary, Swiss-Prot!
 </h3>
 <p>
  On July 21st 1986, the first Swiss-Prot release was created.
    It contained close to 4,000 protein sequence entries and was
    produced by a single graduate student, Amos Bairoch, at the
    University of Geneva. In 1996, while Swiss-Prot was rapidly
    growing (60,000 entries) and was used worldwide, the granting
    agencies could not find a solution to finance it. Without the
    support of thousands of users, Swiss-Prot would not be celebrating
    its 20th anniversary today! This financial crisis was solved by
    the creation of the
  <a href="http://www.isb-sib.ch/">
   SIB Swiss
    Institute of Bioinformatics
  </a>
  , and additional resources
    were provided by license fees paid by commercial users,
    Swiss-Prot remaining freely accessible to the academic community.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first Swiss-Prot annotators used to annotate protein
    sequences concomitant with the submission of the nucleotide
    coding sequences to the EMBL database. However, the increase of
    submissions made it impossible to keep pace. In collaboration
    with the
  <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/">
   European Bioinformatics
    Institute (EBI)
  </a>
  , a solution was found with the creation of
    TrEMBL, a computer-annotated supplement to Swiss-Prot in 1996,
    which contained roughly 60,000 entries in its first release.
 </p>
 <p>
  In 2006, a staff of 60 annotators at the SIB and the EBI,
    supported by a dedicated programming team, is maintaining
    Swiss-Prot. Close to 250,000 entries are currently in the
    knowledgebase. Interestingly, 10 years were necessary to reach
    the first 50,000 protein sequence entries, while 50,000 proteins
    can now be manually annotated in about 18 months. In parallel,
    TrEMBL's exponential growth results in a database containing
    close to 3 millions entries.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since 2002, both databases are at the heart of the UniProt
    project and together they constitute the
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/uniprotkb">
   UniProt
    Knowledgebase (UniProtKB)
  </a>
  , one of 3 UniProt components. UniProt
    is produced by a collaboration between 3 institutes, SIB, EBI and
    PIR (Protein Information Resource). This single, centralized,
    authoritative resource for protein sequences and functional
    information aims to make protein data available, to facilitate
    their retrieval and to provide new tools to help in their analysis.
    Since Swiss-Prot became UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, the access to the
    knowledgebase is free again for commercial users. Currently 160
    persons are involved in the UniProt services to the scientific community.
 </p>
 <p>
  The means have changed, but the 20 year old key idea of a
    graduate student to share knowledge is still, and more than ever, vivid.

  Large scale analyses

 <p>
  The term 'LARGE SCALE ANALYSIS' was added in RP lines for
    references that report large screen results to indicate that
    results have not been extensively studied.
