  New comment line (CC) topic RNA EDITING
 </h3>
 <p>
  We have introduced a new comment (CC) line topic: 'RNA EDITING'. This topic
is used to convey information relevant to all types of RNA editing that
lead to one or more amino acid changes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The format of this comment block is:
 </p>
 <pre>
CC   -!- RNA EDITING: Modified_positions={x[, y, z, ...] | Not_applicable | Undetermined}[; Note=Text].
</pre>
 <p>
  Examples:
 </p>
 <pre>
CC   -!- RNA EDITING: Modified_positions=393, 431, 452, 495.
</pre>
 <pre>
CC   -!- RNA EDITING: Modified_positions=59, 78, 94, 98, 102, 121; Note=The
CC       stop codon at position 121 is created by RNA editing. The nonsense
CC       codon at position 59 is modified to a sense codon.
</pre>
 <pre>
CC   -!- RNA EDITING: Modified_positions=Not_applicable; Note=Some
CC       positions are modified by RNA editing via nucleotide insertion or
CC       deletion. The initiator methionine is created by RNA editing.

  Headlines: Monkey business!
 </h3>
 <p>
  The comparison of the genome of human with that of higher apes such as
     chimpanzees, gibbons, gorillas and the orangutans, was for a long time
     a wish of many life scientists.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is becoming a reality due to various sequencing initiatives
     targeted toward the elucidation of primate genomic sequences. However
     it will take some time before a significant amount of high quality
     complete protein sequences are available. In the meanwhile we are
     trying to ensure that whenever an existing higher ape sequence is
     available that correspond to a cognate human protein, that sequence
     gets annotated very quickly.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, in the last two weeks, the number of annotated
      chimpanzees protein sequences in Swiss-Prot has doubled.

  Content changes in the speclist.txt document file
 </h3>
 <p>
  The
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/docs/speclist">
   speclist.txt
  </a>
  file lists the
organism identification codes which are used to build the "organism" part of an
entry name (Examples: ARATH, BACSU, DROME, HUMAN, etc). This file contains for each
organism code, the corresponding NCBI taxonomic database node identifier (TaxID) as
well as the specific official (scientific) name and optionally common name and synonym.
 </p>
 <p>
  Up to now organisms identification codes where only used in Swiss-Prot where all
species represented in the database are associated with such a code. The TrEMBL section
of the combined UniProt knowledgebase will soon also make use of entry names that are
based on the species of origin. As it is not possible in a reasonable time frame
to manually assign organism codes to all species represented in TrEMBL, it
was decided to define "virtual" codes that regroup organisms at a certain taxonomic
level. Such codes are prefixed by the number "9" and generally correspond to a "pool"
of organisms which can be 'wide' as a kingdom. Here are some examples of such codes:
 </p>
 <pre>
9BACT B      2: N=Bacteria
9CNID E   6073: N=Cnidaria
9FUNG E   4751: N=Fungi
9REOV V  10880: N=Reoviridae
9TETR E  32523: N=Tetrapoda
9VIRI E  33090: N=Viridiplantae
</pre>
 <p>
  The list of all the "9" codes that have been defined are now been integrated as a subsection
of the speclist.txt file.

  Headlines: More than 10'000 human proteins have been annotated
 </h3>
 <p>
  In the framework of the
  <a href="http://www.expasy.org/sprot/hpi/">
   HPI
  </a>
  project, we have
    annotated more than 10'000 proteins (almost 10'300). The exact number of
    genes represented is not exactly equal to the number of proteins for at
     least four reasons:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   We have entries that describe proteins encoded by more than one gene
       but whose amino acid sequences are 100% identical;
  </li>
  <li>
   We sometimes are unable to describe highly divergent splice isoforms
        in one entry and these genes are therefore represented by two or more
       Swiss-Prot entries;
  </li>
  <li>
   For MHC histocompatibility antigens, immunoglobulin and T cell receptors,
       we often have several entries representing groups of alleles;
  </li>
  <li>
   A very small number of human entries probably represent "bogus" proteins
       originating from either pseudogenes or from contaminants.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  But even taking the above factors into account, we do have more than 10'000
     protein-encoding genes represented in Swiss-Prot.
 </p>
 <h3>
  Cross-references to DictyBase
 </h3>
 <p>
  We have added cross-references to the DictyBase database (available at
  <a href="http://dictybase.org/">
   http://dictybase.org/
  </a>
  ), an
online informatics resource for Dictyostelium discoideum.
DictyBase goals are to provide a single portal for access to Dictyostelium genome
information, curated Dictyostelium literature, to facilitate access to experimental
resources such as the Dictyostelium stock center, and to provide an on-line presence
for the Dictyostelium community.

  Case and wording change for submissions to Swiss-Prot in reference location (RL) lines
 </h3>
 <p>
  While proceeding with the conversion to mixed case of the different line
types of a Swiss-Prot entry, we have decided to do the same for the name of
our database, e.g. we are now using "Swiss-Prot" (instead of previously "SWISS-PROT")
as the prevalent way of referring to it. This change affects the Swiss-Prot RL
(reference location) lines of entries which were submitted directly to Swiss-Prot,
and which the authors have not (yet) published. At the same time, we have changed
the wording of those lines.
 </p>
 <p>
  Former format:

  Headlines: Annotation of microbial H(+)-translocating pyrophosphatases
 </h3>
 <p>
  We have annotated the microbial H(+)-translocating pyrophosphatases
     present in the acidocalcisome, the first eukaryotic organelle to be found in bacteria.
 </p>
 <p>
  Acidocalcisomes are organelles that have an acidic nature, high eletronic density and contain
     high concentrations of calcium, magnesium, pyrophosphate and polyP. They were originally found
     in unicellular eukaryotes, such as Toxoplasma gondii and trypanosomatids. It has been postulated
     that acidocalcisomes may have an important role as an energy source and in the regulation of
     intracellualr pH, calcium concentration and osmotic conditions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now the group of Roberto Docampo has found them in the bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens. This
      is the first organelle to be found in bacteria that have a direct counterpart in eukaryotes. The
      typical characteristic of the acidocalcisome is the presence of a number of pumps and exchangers:
      one of them is the H(+)-translocating pyrophosphatase (H+-PPase). This pump generates a proton motive
      force and may be responsible for the synthesis of pyrophosphate. They are found in several bacteria
      and archaea and at present it is unkown whether any of these is also localized in acidocalcisomes.
      As these pumps are present only in some pathogenic bacteria but not in humans, drugs that target them
     might be effective against these infections.

  The feature keys THIOETH and THIOLEST have been removed.
Various bonds between amino-acids that used to be described by the feature keys
BINDING, MOD_RES or SITE will progressively, in
groups according the type of PTM, be modified and indicated by CROSSLNK.
Disulfide bonds occur so often in proteins, that we decided to keep the special
feature key DISULFID to annotate this kind of linkage.

  Headlines: Complete update of PDB cross-references
 </h3>
 <p>
  We have completely updated our cross-references to PDB. Thanks to work done by
     the EBI and Geneva Swiss-Prot groups in collaboration with the EBI MSD
     (Macromolecular Structure Database) group we have mapped at the atom level PDB
     structural data to the relevant Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL entries. This
     work has led to the introduction of cross-references to PDB in TrEMBL and a
     very significant increase in the number of these cross-references in Swiss-Prot.
     More than 6'000 cross-references were added and the number of Swiss-Prot entries
     that are linked to PDB is now above 5'300 (versus about 3'600 before this work
     was carried out).

  New syntax of the CC line topic ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS
 </h3>
 <p>
  In Swiss-Prot release 41.1 (and in the accompanying TrEMBL release), a new
format was introduced for "CC ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS" lines.  The new format is
more structured than the previous format.  Associated with these changes are the
introduction of stable identifiers for each named splice isoform in all entries
that describe more than one splice isoform; the extension of feature
identifiers, previously only used for human VARIANT  and certain CARBOHYD features, to VARSPLIC
features in entries from all species.
 </p>
 <p>
  The new format of the CC line topic ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS is:
 </p>
 <pre>
CC   -!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
CC       Event=Alternative promoter;
CC         Comment=Free text;

  Swiss-Prot release 41.0, 28-Feb-2003
 </h2>
 <h3>
  Progress in the conversion of Swiss-Prot to mixed-case characters
 </h3>
 <p>
  We are gradually converting Swiss-Prot entries from all UPPER CASE
to MiXeD CaSe. With this release the RC (Reference Comment) line
topic STRAIN and the CC line topic CATALYTIC ACTIVITY have been converted.
 </p>
 <h3>
  "Nucleomorph" added to the OrGanelle (OG) line
 </h3>
 <p>
  The OG (OrGanelle) line indicates from which genome a gene for a protein
originates. Until now, defined terms in the OG line where "Chloroplast",
"Cyanelle", "Mitochondrion" and "Plasmid".
The term "Nucleomorph" has been added, which is the
residual nucleus of an algal endosymbiont that resides inside its host cell.
 </p>
 <h3>
  Multiple RP lines
 </h3>
 <p>
  Starting with release 41, there can be more than one RP (Reference
Position) line per reference in a Swiss-Prot entry. The RP line describes
the extent of the work carried out by the authors of the reference, e.g.
the type of molecule that has been sequenced, protein characterization,
PTM characterization, protein structure analysis, variation detection, etc.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the number of experimental results per publication has increased over
the years, the limitation of using a single RP line per reference no longer
allowed to add all the information while maintaining a consistent format.
Therefore we decided to permit multiple RP lines.
 </p>
 <p>
  Example:
 </p>
 <pre>
RP   SEQUENCE FROM N.A., SEQUENCE OF 23-42 AND 351-365, AND
RP   CHARACTERIZATION.

    The values are either '-', 'fused', 'atypical' or 'atypical/fused'. The value '-' is a placeholder for an
  empty field; the 'fused' value indicates that the family rule does not cover the entire protein; the value
  'atypical' points out that the protein is divergent in sequence or has mutated functional sites, and should not be included in family
  datasets. The value 'atypical/fused' indicates both latter findings.

  Explicit links to dbSNP in FT VARIANT lines of human sequence entries
 </h3>
 <p>
  In human protein sequence entries we have introduced explicit links to the Single
Nucleotide Polymorphism database (
  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/">
   dbSNP
  </a>
  )
from the feature description of FT VARIANT keys.
 </p>
 <p>
  The format of such links is:
 </p>
 <pre>
FT   VARIANT    from     to   description (IN dbSNP:accession_number).
FT                                /FTId=VAR_number.
</pre>
 Example:
 <pre>
FT   VARIANT      65     65       T -&gt; I (IN dbSNP:1065419).
FT                                /FTId=VAR_012009.
</pre>
 <h3>
  Feature key SIMILAR became obsolete
 </h3>
 <p>
  The feature key SIMILAR was used to describe the extent of a similarity with another
protein sequence. Nowadays, most domains with similarity to other proteins are known
regions described in domain and family databases, which are annotated in Swiss-Prot with
the feature key DOMAIN or REPEAT and the comment (CC) line topic SIMILARITY; thus the
feature key SIMILAR became obsolete and will not be used again.

  Version of SP in XML format
 </h3>
 <p>
  A distribution version of Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL in XML format is being
developed. The first draft of the XML specification was released for public
review on February 21, 2002.
