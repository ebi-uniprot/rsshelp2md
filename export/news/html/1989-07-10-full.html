                         1. INTRODUCTION

   1.1  Evolution

   Release 11.0 of SWISS-PROT contains 10856 sequence entries,
   comprising 3'265'966  amino  acids  abstracted  from  10775
   references. This  represents an increase of 9% over release
   10.0. The  recent growth  of the  data bank  is  summarised
   below:

   1.2  Source of data

   Release 11.0  has been  updated using protein sequence data
   from  release  20.0  of  the  PIR  (Protein  Identification
   Resource) protein  data bank,  as well  as  translation  of
   nucleotide sequence  data from  release 19.0  of  the  EMBL
   nucleotide sequence Data Library.

   As an  indication to the source of the sequence data in the
   SWISS-PROT data bank we list here the statistics concerning
   the DR (Databank Reference) pointer lines:

   Entries with pointer(s) to only PIR entri(es):          2992
   Entries with pointer(s) to only EMBL entri(es):         3875
   Entries with pointer(s) to both EMBL and PIR entri(es): 3272
   Entries with no pointers lines (entered in house):       717



     2. DESCRIPTION OF THE CHANGES MADE TO SWISS-PROT SINCE
                           RELEASE 10


   2.1  Sequences and annotations

   Some 848  new sequences  have been  added  since  the  last
   release, the sequence data of 113 existing entries has been
   updated and  the annotations  of  1366  entries  have  been
   revised. In  particular we  have used  reviews articles  to
   update the  annotations of the following groups or families
   of proteins:

      Adenylate kinases
      Bacterial restriction systems proteins
      Bacterial transduction systems proteins
      Caseins
      Chitin-binding proteins
      Cutinases
      Cytochromes P450
      DNA polymerases
      DNA topoisomerases type I
      Esterases
      Heat shock hsp70 proteins
      Lipases
      Microtubule-associated proteins
      2-oxo acid dehydrogenases complex components
      Paramyxoviruses proteins
      Protein disulfide isomerases
      Purine/pyrimidine phosphoribosyl transferases
      Rhabdoviruses proteins
      Ribonucleotide reductases
      Rotaviruses proteins
      Serine hydroxymethyltransferases
      Small, acid-soluble spore proteins
      Xylose isomerases


   2.2  Standardized journal abbreviations

   Journal  names   are  now   abbreviated  according  to  the
   conventions  used  by  the  National  Library  of  Medicine
   (Washington D.C.,  USA) and  are based  on the existing ISO
   and ANSI  standards. In  most cases  the changes are small,
   and the  new abbreviations  are at  least as  meaningful as
   the old ones. As in previous releases the abbreviations for
   the journals cited in SWISS-PROT are listed in the document
   file JOURLIST.TXT


   2.3  New feature key

   A new  feature key  has been  introduced in  this  release:
   THIOETH, which  describes  a  thioether  bond  between  two
   residues.



                       3. THE NEXT RELEASE

   SWISS-PROT release 12.0 will be available in November 1989.




                     4. WE NEED YOUR HELP !

   We welcome any feedback from our users. We especially would
   appreciate that  you notify  us if  you find that sequences
   belonging to  your field  of expertise are missing from the
   data  bank.  We  also  would  like  to  be  notified  about
   annotations to  be updated,  as for example if the function
   of  a   protein  has   been  clarified   or  if  new  post-
   translational information has become available.
