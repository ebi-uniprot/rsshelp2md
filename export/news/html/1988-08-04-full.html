                         1. INTRODUCTION

   1.1  Evolution

   Release 8.0  of SWISS-PROT  contains 7724 sequence entries,
   comprising  2'224'465  amino  acids  abstracted  from  8088
   references. This represents an increase of 13% over release
   7.0. The  recent growth  of the  data  bank  is  summarised

   1.2  Source of data

   Release 8.0  has been  updated using  protein sequence data
   from  release  16.0  of  the  PIR  (Protein  Identification
   Resource) protein  data bank,  as well  as  translation  of
   nucleotide sequence  data from  release 15.0  of  the  EMBL
   nucleotide sequence Data Library.

   As an  indication to the source of the sequence data in the
   SWISS-PROT data bank we list here the statistics concerning
   the DR (Databank Reference) pointer lines:

   Entries with pointer(s) to only PIR entri(es):          3385
   Entries with pointer(s) to only EMBL entri(es):         2084
   Entries with pointer(s) to both EMBL and PIR entri(es): 2057
   Entries with no pointers lines (entered in house):       198



     2. DESCRIPTION OF THE CHANGES MADE TO SWISS-PROT SINCE
                            RELEASE 7


   2.1  Sequences and annotations

   Some 903  new sequences  have been  added  since  the  last
   release, the  sequence data of 93 existing entries has been
   updated and  the annotations  of almost  2400 entries  have
   been revised.  In particular  we have used reviews articles
   to update  the  annotations  of  the  following  groups  or
   families of proteins:

        1,6-fructose-bisphosphate aldolases.
        Alkaline phosphatases.
        Annexins.
        Endo- and Exo-glucanases.
        Bacterial ferredoxins.
        Beta-adrenergic receptors.
        Chemotaxis proteins.
        Collagens.
        Complement proteins.
        Cytochrome B5.
        Cytosolic lipid-binding proteins.
        Fumarases.
        Malate dehydrogenases.
        Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.
        Opsins.
        Protamines.
        PTS system proteins.
        RNA polymerase sigma factors.
        Serpins.
        Small, acid-soluble spore proteins (SASP).
        Tachykinins.
        TGF-beta/Inhibins/MIS.
        Zinc-finger proteins.
        Zinc metallo endopeptidases.


   2.2  New feature table keys

   Two  new  feature  keys  have  been  introduced  with  this
   release:

   ZN_FING:   Extent of a "zinc-finger" region.

   NP_BIND:   Extent  of   a   nucleotide   phosphate  binding
              region. The  nature of  the nucleotide phosphate
              is indicated  in the description field. Examples
              of NP_BIND key feature lines:

   FT   NP_BIND      13     25       ATP.
   FT   NP_BIND      45     49       GTP (POTENTIAL).


   2.3  Enhancement in the format of the CC line

   A major  proportion of  the comment blocks are now arranged
   according to what we designate as 'topics`, the format of a
   comment block which belongs to a 'topic` is:

   CC    -!- TOPIC: FREE TEXT DESCRIPTION.

   The current topics and their definition are:

   CATALYTIC ACTIVITY Description of the reaction(s) catalysed
                      by an enzyme [*].
   DISEASE            Description of the disease(s) associated
                      with a deficiency of a protein.
   FUNCTION           General description  of the  function(s)
                      of a protein.
   INDUCTION          Description  of  the  compound(s)  which
                      stimulate the synthesis of a protein.
   PATHWAY            Description of  the metabolic pathway(s)
                      to which is associated a protein.
   SIMILARITY         Description   of    the   similariti(es)
                      (sequence or  structural) of  a  protein
                      with other proteins.
   SUBCELLULAR LOCATION     Description  of   the  subcellular
                      location of a mature protein product.
   SUBUNIT            Description of  the quaternary structure
                      of a protein.

   [*]  Whenever it was possible we have used, to describe the
      catalytic activity  of an enzyme, the recommendations of
      the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of
      Biochemistry (IUB) as published in:

      Enzyme Nomenclature,  NC-IUB, Academic  Press, New-York,
      (1984).
      and
      Supplement  1:   Corrections  and   Additions,  Eur.  J.
      Biochem. 157:1-26(1986).

   Here is,  for each  of the topics defined above, an example
   of its usage:

   CC   -!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + L-GLUTAMATE + NH(3) =
   CC       ADP + GLUTAMINE + ORTHOPHOSPHATE.
   CC   -!- DISEASE: NADH-CYTOCHROME B5 REDUCTASE DEFICIENCY
   CC       CAUSES HEREDITARY METHEMOGLOBINEMIA.
   CC   -!- FUNCTION: PREVENTS THE POLYMERIZATION OF ACTIN.
   CC   -!- INDUCTION: ARGINASE ACTIVITY CAN BE INDUCED BY
   CC       ARGININE OR HOMOARGININE.
   CC   -!- PATHWAY: FIRST STEP IN PROLINE BIOSYNTHESIS.
   CC   -!- SIMILARITY: WITH SUBTILISINS, THERMITASE, AND
   CC       PROTEINASE K.
   CC   -!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: MITOCHONDRIAL MATRIX.
   CC   -!- SUBUNIT: TETRAMER OF IDENTICAL CHAINS.


   2.4  Small change in the format of the RN line

   The syntax  of RN  lines  for  articles  which  report  the
   sequence of a protein translated from a nucleotide sequence
   used to  be "SEQUENCE  TRANSL. FROM N.A. SEQ.", and has now
   been changed to "SEQUENCE FROM N.A."

   Examples:

   RN   [1] (SEQUENCE FROM N.A.)
   RN   [1] (SEQUENCE OF 12-143 FROM N.A.)


   2.5 Changes in the documentation

   The document  file SPECFREQ.TXT  which was used to list the
   frequency table  of usage  of  the  species  identification
   codes  has  been  discontinued,  this  information  is  now
   included in a new appendix of these release notes (Appendix
   B), along  with other  statistics such  as the  amino  acid
   composition in  the data  bank and  the repartition  of the
   sequences by size (number of residues).



                       3. THE NEXT RELEASE

   SWISS-PROT release  9.0 will be available in December 1988.
   We plan to upgrade the OC lines so as to add at least a few
   level of  taxonomic nodes  (currently  only  the  top-node:
   viridae, prokaryota or eukaryota is available).



                     4. WE NEED YOUR HELP !

   We welcome any feedback from our users. We especially would
   appreciate that  you notify  us if  you find that sequences
   belonging to  your field  of expertise are missing from the
   data  bank.  We  also  would  like  to  be  notified  about
   annotations to  be updated,  as for example if the function
   of  a   protein  has   been  clarified   or  if  new  post-
   translational information has become available.
