  Swiss-Prot in the Wonderland of protein names
 </h3>
 <p>
  Successful basic research requires various skills from scientists, not only
      creativity, but also precision, critical analysis of experimental results,
      reconsideration of the starting hypotheses, continuous controls and days,
      nights and weekends of - sometimes tedious - work in the lab. Thus when
      proteins are eventually purified, genes are cloned and a nice story is wrapped around the
      data, one of the rewards is to name the proteins/genes. There lies the fun.

  Telling names can be useful for remembering a function or a
      phenotype. Interaction of Drosophila

  Acronyms are another part of the naming game. You would expect the
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9VB08">
   RING1
  </a>
  protein to have a specific 3D
      structure related to its name, round, for instance. Actually, RING stands for "Really Interesting New Gene". In the same vein,
      you would not expect
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q7Z6J0">

  , the Roman god of gates, usually
      depicted with two heads looking in opposite directions. However, JAK is also said to be
      'Just Another Kinase', one among the hundreds of essential kinases described so far.
      And last, but not least, the Drosophila

      to the movie "Monty Python and the Holy Grail", in which a live person about to be
      buried rightly protests: 'I'm Not Dead Yet!', which is hardly surprising since mutations in this gene
      result in a near doubling of the average adult life-span. For more amazing
      protein/gene names, see the excellent

  Scientific creativity can be somewhat hampered by economical actors. The

  oncogene for instance - which
      stands for POK erythroid myeloid ontogenic factor - had to
      be withdrawn after the US branch of Japanese video-game franchise Pok√©mon
      threatened researchers with legal action. The protein ended up with the far more sober
      - not to say boring - name of 'Zinc
      finger and BTB domain-containing protein 7A' (
  <a href="http://www.genenames.org/data/hgnc_data.php?hgnc_id=18078">
   ZBTB7A
  </a>
  ).
 </p>
 <p>
  Much ink has been spilled over the lack of standardization of protein names.
      Inconsistency among orthologs, family members and so on makes
      the systematic search through the literature a complicated task. UniProt provides a few
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/docs/nameprot">
   guidelines
  </a>
  for protein naming. Such a document should help to improve consistency,
      keeping a given protein's
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypokeimenon">

  ,
      while not curbing creativity!
