  One million comment lines in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot!
 </h3>
 <p>
  Annotation is the focal point of our effort to maintain and develop
      UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. Many of our manual annotation is found in the
      comment lines, which aim to provide a summary of what
      is known about a protein. There are 27 different types of comment line,
      which are arranged according to what we designate as
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/docs/userman.htm#CC_line">
   'topics'
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Recently, we reached a peak of 1 million CC topic lines. About 97 % of the
      UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries contains at least one CC topic line and,
      currently, there is an average of 4 different CC topic lines per entry.
 </p>
 <p>
  Comment lines are mainly free text, but we have already set up a
      standardised format as well as the use of controlled vocabularies for
      several topics (ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS, BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES,
      CATALYTIC ACTIVITY, DISEASE, INTERACTION, MASS SPECTROMETRY, PATHWAY, RNA
      EDITING, SIMILARITY, TOXIC DOSE...). Standardisation for two further
      topics - SUBCELLULAR LOCATION and CAUTION - are also on their
      way (more:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/docs/sp_soon.htm">
   Forthcoming changes
  </a>
  )
 </p>
 <p>
  The most represented CC topics in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot are:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   SIMILARITY: describes the similaritie(s) (at the sequence or structure
       level) of a protein with other proteins or families of proteins. It can be found in
       91 % of the entries. This topic can however be considered as an
       'outsider' in this ranking as its content is mostly based on protein
       sequence analysis (family and domain scan process or similarity
       searches(BLAST)), and not really on a literature-based annotation.
  </li>
  <li>
   FUNCTION: gives a general description of the function(s) of a protein.
       It is found in 68 % of the entries. Note that over 40 % of this
       functional data has been experimentally proved.
  </li>
  <li>
   SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: describes the subcellular location of the
       mature protein; this information is found in 54 % of the entries (39 % experimentally proven).
  </li>
  <li>
   SUBUNIT: describes the quaternary structure of a
       protein and any kind of interactions with other proteins or protein
       complexes (found in 37 % of the entries).
  </li>
  <li>
   CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: describes the reaction(s) catalyzed by an enzyme (found in 35 % of the entries).
       There are at least as many CC CATALYTIC ACTIVITY line(s) as complete EC number(s)
       in the 'Protein name' section.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Such a distribution reflects the type of experimental biological data
      which is available for a protein sequence nowadays in the scientific
      literature.
 </p>
 <p>
  The data found in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, are continuously updated and -
      since annotators are constantly improving their skills in literature-based
      information retrieval - the 'depth' of manual annotation is always
      increasing. This is highlighted by the fact that we have increased the
      average number of CC topics per entry from 3.5 to 4 since March 2004.
