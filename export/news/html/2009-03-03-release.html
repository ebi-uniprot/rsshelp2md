  Hush, Little Fly...

 <p>
  Most organisms slumber and
  <a href="http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10707978">
   so do flies
  </a>
  .
      As in humans, caffeine or amphetamines keep them
      awake, while antihistamines make them fall asleep. Not surprisingly, prolonged sleep
      deprivation can lead to lethality. These and other similarities prompted researchers to
      use
  <em>
   Drosophila melanogaster
  </em>
  as a
  <a href="http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10727779">
   model
       organism
  </a>
  to study the genetic basis of sleep.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sleep is regulated by two main processes: circadian and
      homeostatic. The first says it is time to sleep, the second signals the need to rest,
      independently of the hour of the day. In July 2008,
  <a href="http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18635795">
   Koh et al.
  </a>
  showed that in
      Drosophila, mutations in a single protein, Quiver, well-renamed
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/B5A5T4">
   Sleepless
  </a>
  by the authors,
      deeply perturb the homeostatic control. Loss of this protein causes an extreme reduction in sleep (&gt;80%).
      About 9% of the flies don't sleep at all. Although the mutants had a shortened lifespan,
      they were still capable of flying and mating!
 </p>
 <p>
  Quiver is thought to act through the regulation of the Shaker K+ channel, lowering
      membrane excitability by modulating its expression and activity. It
      could thus be a signaling molecule that links homeostatic sleep drive to neuronal
      excitability.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although Quiver is well-conserved in other insect species and a
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q565B0">
   potential ortholog
  </a>
  has been identified in
  <em>
   C.elegans
  </em>
  , there are no
      obvious homologs in vertebrates. However, many members of the
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=annotation:(type:similarity+Shaker)">
   Shaker potassium channel family
  </a>
  are known from yeast to humans.
 </p>
 <p>
  If there is indeed a common mechanism for sleep control between humans and flies, one might envision
      relieving some form of insomnia by acting on K+ channels. In the meantime, we advise
      you to keep counting sheep, or flies, when you can't get sleep...
 </p>
 <p>
  Quiver is now available in
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/B5A5T4">
