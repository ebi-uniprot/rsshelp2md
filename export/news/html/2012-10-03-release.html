  New discovery for an old virus: PA-X, influenza’s twelfth protein

   Influenza A virus

  (IAV) remains a major cause of human mortality and morbidity due to its remarkable genetic variability which limits vaccine effectiveness. Understanding the determinants of influenza virus molecular biology is a fundamental step for effective control of viral epidemics, and this virus has been the subject of intensive research efforts for more than 60 years. The viral

   the twelfth protein of influenza A virus
  </a>
  . This protein is expressed by an unusual ribosomal frameshifting in the polymerase acidic (PA) protein open reading frame encoded on segment 3. The frameshift product, called PA-X, comprises the endonuclease domain of the viral PA protein with a C-terminal domain encoded by the X-ORF. Its function is to repress cellular gene expression and modulate

  virus 30 years after it was first sequenced, because non-structural viral proteins are often difficult to identify in the midst of host proteins. Moreover, PA-X expression relies on an unusual ribosomal frameshift which could not be predicted. This new finding will allow a better understanding of host-virus interactions and improve the surveillance of new outbreaks.
