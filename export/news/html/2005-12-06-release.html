  200'000 entries in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
 </h3>
 <p>
  The Swiss-Prot group is happy to announce that a total number
    of 200'000 manually annotated entries has been reached in
    UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. It took 15 years and 2 months to reach the
    first 100'000 entries in September 2001, but only 4 years and 2
    months to reach 200'000 entries. The first
    (
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P99999">
   P99999
  </a>
  ) and the
    200'000th (
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q52V10">
   Q52V10
  </a>
  ) entries deal
    with human and common squirrel monkey cytochrome c, respectively.
    Both were created by Amos Bairoch, who founded the knowledgebase,
    the first in July 1986 and the last in November 2005.
 </p>
 <p>
  We would like to acknowledge our users, who provide continous
    support by suggesting entry updates, by sharing their expertise
    in order to increase annotation quality or simply by using
    UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many thanks also to all annotators, programmers, system
    administrators, administrative support persons, members of the
    UniProt Consortium, who have contributed to this major
    achievement.
