  Uncleaved N-terminal translocation signals
 </h3>
 <p>
  The translocation of a protein to another subcellular compartment
      requires the existence of at least one translocation signal specific to the
      relevant trafficking mechanism across the membrane. Proteins destined for
      secretion, incorporation into the plasma membrane, chloroplast, cyanelle,
      microbodies or the mitochondrial matrix usually possess an N-terminal
      transfer signal, which is cleaved during the transfer process. Recently,
      some proteins have been found to obviously get around this cleavage step.
      In some cases, the uncleaved signal peptide even confers important
      functional properties to the protein (

  ).

  In the current Swiss-Prot release, the annotation of
      23 protein entries indicates an uncleaved signal sequence (e.g.
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/O95445#section_features">
   O95445
  </a>
  ) and the
      transit peptide of the mitochondrial 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase was reported
      to be not removed (

  ).
