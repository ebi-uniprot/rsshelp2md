  Obesity in the spotlight
 </h3>
 <p>
  Over the last 40 years, overweight and obesity have become a central health
  <a href="http://www.who.int/topics/obesity/en/">
   issue
  </a>
  in a growing number of countries.
      Obesity comorbidities are severe and include cardiovascular diseases, diabetes,
      musculoskeletal disorders and some cancers. The two fundamental causes of
      obesity are clearly identified as an increased intake of high-fat and energy-dense diets and a decrease of physical activity. However, there is growing
      evidence that certain gene products have a direct or indirect influence on body
      mass.

  In 1999, the mouse Fto gene was cloned and called
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q8BGW1">
   Fatso
  </a>
  , because of its
  <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s003359901144">
   large size
  </a>
  (at least 250 kb).
      By a curious coincidence, the human orthologous
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9C0B1">
   protein
  </a>
  was recently shown to predispose to childhood and adult

   obesity
  </a>
  . The main culprits are
  <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ng2048">
   intronic variations
  </a>
  in the FTO
      gene. Carriers of one (or two) inherited copy (copies) of the
      variants have an increased risk of obesity of 30% or 70%, respectively. The
      function of Fatso is not yet known. This protein, along with other proteins
      involved in the development of obesity, can be retrieved from the
      UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot using the keyword
