  Looking for Titin
 </h3>
 <p>
  "I am looking for Titine" Charlie Chaplin sang in Modern Times. While for many
                people Titin brings back memories about this song, for the scientific community
                the meaning is completely different. Titin is a giant sarcomeric protein of
                roughly 35'000 aa. Protein analysis programs used to crash when encountering
                huge proteins, and the size limit of a protein to be integrated into
                UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot used to be under 10'000 aa long. Modern times finally
                arrived and bioinformatics has improved by leaps and bounds. Programs are now
                able to deal with huge proteins and

   titin
  </a>
  has finally been integrated into UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.

  Titin is a long (up to 1 micron),
  <a href="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/smd_imd/titin/titin-pull-graph.mov">
   slender and flexible strand
  </a>
  ,
                frequently with a large
                globule at one end. It has a complex modular structure that varies depending on
                the splicing events. In its longest form it may contain up to 132 fibronectin
                type-III domains, 152 Ig-like domains, 9 Kelch, 17 RCC1, 14 TPR, 15 WD and 31
                PEVK repeats and 1 protein kinase domain. Titin functions as a mechanical
                sensor through its interaction with many other proteins, such as myomesins,
                tropomyosins, myosins, actins, myopalladin, etc. By providing connections at
                the level of individual microfilaments, it contributes to the fine balance of
                forces between the two halves of the sarcomere and thus to muscle extensibility.
                In non-muscle cells, it seems to play a role in chromosome condensation and
                segregation during mitosis.

  Needless to say, the titin-seeking of Charlie Chaplin was a legitimate demand,
                because all human beings need titin in their life.
