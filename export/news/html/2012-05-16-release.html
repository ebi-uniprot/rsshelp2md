  Sex by deception
 </h3>
 <p>
  All is fair in love and war and… species survival, including the most brazen cheating. In this context, strategies developed by orchids of the genus
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/59329">
   <em>
    Ophrys
   </em>
  </a>
  to attract pollinators are astounding. While the majority of flowering plants achieve pollination by exploiting the food-seeking behavior of animals,
  <em>
   Ophrys
  </em>
  uses alternative ploys that exploit their mate-seeking behavior. These beautiful flowers imitate female insects to attract males, predominantly male hymenoptera. They mimic the insect body through one modified petal, called the labellum, but the misleading cues are not only visual and tactile: they are also chemical. During development the
  <em>
   Ophrys
  </em>
  labellum accumulates substances that mimic sex pheromones – which consist mostly of cuticular hydrocarbons, such as alkanes and alkenes – that induce the pollinator to attempt mating (pseudocopulation) with the labellum. During pseudocopulation, pollen becomes attached to the hapless suitor, which transfers this pollen to other flowers when it is once again enticed into pseudocopulation.
 </p>
 <p>
  This pollination system is highly specialized, with each orchid species targeting a single pollinator with chemical cues consisting of alkenes whose specificity is determined by the precise position of the double bonds. This allows even closely related
  <em>
   Ophrys
  </em>
  species, living in the same environment and in the absence of geographic barriers, to remain reproductively separated, since they attract different insects. The enzymes involved in
  <em>
   Ophrys
  </em>
  alkene synthesis have been

  Update to Reference proteomes in UniProtKB
 </h3>
 <p>
  With the significant increase in the number of complete genomes sequenced, it is critically important to organize this data in a way that allows users to effectively navigate the growing number of available complete proteome sequences. In collaboration with
  <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/index.html">
   Ensembl
  </a>
  and the
  <span class="caps">
   NCBI
  </span>
  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/">
   Reference Sequence collection
  </a>
  , UniProt began this organization by defining a set of ‘reference proteomes’. These were first introduced in UniProt release 2011_09 and the keyword
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-1185">
   ‘Reference proteome’
  </a>
  was created to allow their easy retrieval.
 </p>
 <p>
  The number of reference proteomes has grown from 455 in UniProt release 2011_09 to 549 in release 2012_05. The proteomes have been selected to provide broad coverage of the tree of life, and constitute a representative cross-section of the taxonomic diversity to be found within UniProtKB.
 </p>
 <p>
  The reference proteome will be continuously reviewed as new proteomes of interest become available and as existing taxonomic classifications are revised. We would very much welcome feedback on our current list of reference proteomes and suggestions for new candidates via
