  Complete proteome for
  <em>
   Arabidopsis thaliana
  </em>
  in UniProtKB
 </h3>
 <p>
  <em>
   Arabidopsis thaliana
  </em>
  was the first plant to have its genome completely sequenced.
      A first round of
  <a href="http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11130711">
   annotation
  </a>
  was
      performed in 2001 by the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative. The genome was later reannotated and
      is now maintained by The Arabidopsis Information Resource (
  <a href="http://www.arabidopsis.org/">
   TAIR
  </a>
  )
      which assumes primary responsibility for Arabidopsis genome annotation.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the genome sequencing was being completed, Swiss-Prot initiated the
      Plant Proteome Annotation Program (
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/program/Plants">
   PPAP
  </a>
  ) whose
      main focus is the annotation of Arabidopsis (and rice) plant-specific proteins and protein families.
 </p>
 <p>
  This ongoing program has so far produced more than

  manually annotated
  <em>
   Arabidopsis thaliana
  </em>
  protein sequences in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. In addition, close
      to
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy:3702+AND+reviewed:no">
   44'000
  </a>
  Arabidopsis entries are available in UniProtKB/TrEMBL with a certain level of redundancy.
      Thus, the total number of protein sequences in UniProtKB for this model plant is much higher than
      the current estimate of 27'029 protein-encoding genes
      (see
  <a href="http://www.arabidopsis.org/portals/genAnnotation/gene_structural_annotation/annotation_data.jsp">
   TAIR7 release
  </a>
  of April 2007).
      To get around this problem, a non-redundant set of Arabidopsis proteins, including nuclear,
      mitochondrial and chloroplastic proteins, was created as of this release and
      the selected entries have been labelled with the keyword 'Complete proteome' to allow easy retrieval.
 </p>
 <p>
  The current complete proteome contains a total of 29'315 entries:

  <em>
   Arabidopsis thaliana
  </em>
  is the third 'green plant' (Viridiplantae) for which a complete nonredundant protein
      set has been created in UniProtKB. The other two are the unicellular green algae
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy:70448+AND+keyword:181">
   Ostreococcus tauri
  </a>
  and
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy:436017+AND+keyword:181">
   Ostreococcus lucimarinus
  </a>
