 <h3>
  Orangutan, the most represented non-human primate in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
 </h3>
 <p>
  With more than 500 entries,
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/9600">
   <strong>
    Pongo pygmaeus (Orangutan)
   </strong>
  </a>
  is now the most represented non-human primate.
      Most of these entries are built around sequence data generated by a cDNA sequencing
      project launched by the
  <a href="http://mips.gsf.de/proj/cdna/Sites/PP_cDNA_Project.htm">
   German cDNA Consortium
  </a>
  in 2003.
      Almost 4'000 entries
      submitted by the consortium are still in UniProtKB/TrEMBL. It should be noted however that
      some of these sequences are fragments and are thus not a priority for UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
      annotation. We plan to manually annotate as many Orangutan entries as possible,
      starting with sequences orthologous to human ones already described in Swiss-Prot.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are currently almost 15'500 primate entries in Swiss-Prot, 82% of which describe human proteins.

 <h3>
  Obsolete file uniprot_trembl_varsplic.fasta.gz
 </h3>
 <p>
  All UniProtKB/TrEMBL entries with annotated alternative splicing events
(KW Alternative splicing) have been moved to UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. Thus the
file uniprot_trembl_varsplic.fasta.gz became obsolete and has been removed
from the ftp site.
 </p>
 <p>
  Please note that UniProtKB/TrEMBL still includes splice isoforms, but each in an
individual entry and not merged into one single entry.

  Cross-references to Genew
 </h3>
 <p>
  The format of the UniProtKB cross-reference to the Human Gene Nomenclature Database
  <a href="http://www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/nomenclature/searchgenes.pl">
   Genew
  </a>
  has
changed: The term Genew has been replaced by HGNC, which stands for HUGO Gene
Nomenclature Committee.
 </p>
 <p>
  Example:
 </p>
 <pre>DR Genew; HGNC:12849; YWHAB.</pre>
 <p>
  has changed to
 </p>
