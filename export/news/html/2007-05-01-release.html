  We have introduced the oldest fossil protein sequence to date into
      UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, i.e. several peptides from collagen (

      which were extracted from a 68 million year-old dinosaur:

   Tyrannosaurus
       rex
  </a>
  . These collagen sequences were obtained by mass spectrometry analysis
     directly from soft tissue that remained in fossilized bones, which were
      unearthed from rocks in the Hell Creek Formation of eastern Montana, US.

  Interestingly, Tyrannosaurus rex collagen is similar to chicken collagen,
     and similarities have also been found with frog and newt protein. The finding
     is consistent with the idea that we can trace a direct evolutionary line
     between birds and dinosaurs (for more information:

  The discovery of protein in bone soft tissue of dinosaur is a surprise - it
     was not thought that such organic material could survive this long. "The
     pathways of cellular decay are well known for modern organisms. And
     extrapolations predict that all organic matter vanishes within 100,000
      years, maximum" (

  Until now, the oldest fossil protein sequence in UniprotKB/Swiss-Prot was
     a RuBisCO large subunit from a fossil leaf of a Miocene (17-20 million
      years old)
