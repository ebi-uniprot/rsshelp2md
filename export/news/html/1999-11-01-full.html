                         1. Introduction


TrEMBL is a computer-annotated protein sequence database supplementing the
SWISS-PROT Protein Sequence Data Bank. TrEMBL contains the translations of
all coding sequences (CDS) present in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database
not yet integrated in SWISS-PROT. TrEMBL can be considered as a preliminary
section of SWISS-PROT. For all TrEMBL entries which should finally be
upgraded to the standard SWISS-PROT quality, SWISS-PROT accession numbers
have been assigned.


                        2. Why a supplement to SWISS-PROT?

The ongoing gene sequencing and mapping projects have dramatically
increased the number of protein sequences to be incorporated into SWISS-PROT.
We do not want to dilute the quality standards of SWISS-PROT by incorporating
sequences without proper sequence analysis and annotation, but we do want to
make the sequences available as fast as possible. TrEMBL achieves this second
goal, and is a major step in the process of speeding up subsequent
upgrading of annotation to the standard SWISS-PROT quality.
To address the problem of redundancy, the translations of all coding
sequences (CDS) in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database already included
in SWISS-PROT have been removed from TrEMBL.


                             3. The Release

This TrEMBL release was created from the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database
release 60 and contains 276'472 sequence entries, comprising 75'524'740 amino
acids. To minimize redundancy, the translations of all coding sequences (CDS)
in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database already included in SWISS-PROT release
38 and updates up to 18.10.1999 have been removed from TrEMBl release 12.

TrEMBL is split in two main sections: SP-TrEMBL and REM-TrEMBL:
SP-TrEMBL (SWISS-PROT TrEMBL) contains the entries (225'878) which should be
eventually incorporated into SWISS-PROT. SWISS-PROT accession numbers have
been assigned for all SP-TrEMBL entries.

SP-TrEMBL is organized in subsections:

arc.dat (Archaea):             10017 entries
fun.dat (Fungi):                7130 entries
hum.dat (Human):                9417 entries
inv.dat (Invertebrates):       26516 entries
mam.dat (Other Mammals):        3498 entries
mhc.dat (MHC proteins):         4563 entries
org.dat (Organelles):          18368 entries
phg.dat (Bacteriophages):       2201 entries
pln.dat (Plants):              18993 entries
pro.dat (Prokaryotes):         51151 entries
rod.dat (Rodents):              7992 entries
unc.dat (Unclassified):          129 entries
vrl.dat (Viruses):             61006 entries
vrt.dat (Other Vertebrates):    4897 entries

28'141 new entries have been integrated in SP-TrEMBL. The sequences of
522 SP-TrEMBL entries have been updated and the annotation has been updated in
56'201 entries.

In the document deleteac.txt, you will find a list of all accession numbers
which were previously present in TrEMBL, but which have now been deleted from
the database.

REM-TrEMBL (REMaining TrEMBL) contains the entries (50'594) that we do
not want to include in SWISS-PROT. REM-TrEMBL entries have no accession
numbers. This section is organized in six subsections:

   1) Immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors (Immuno.dat)
      Most REM-TrEMBL entries are  immunoglobulins and  T-cell receptors. We
      stopped entering immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors into SWISS-PROT,
      because we only want to keep  the  germ line gene derived translations
      of these proteins in SWISS-PROT and not all known somatic recombinated
      variations of  these proteins.  We would like to  create a specialized
      database  dealing  with  these  sequences  as a further  supplement to
      SWISS-PROT  and  keep  only a  representative  cross-section of  these
      proteins in SWISS-PROT.

   2) Synthetic sequences (Synth.dat)
      Another category of data, which will not be included in SWISS-PROT are
      synthetic sequences.  Again, we do not want to  leave these entries in
      TrEMBL. Ideally one should build a specialized database for artificial
      sequences as a further supplement to SWISS-PROT.

   3) Patent application sequences (Patent.dat)
      A third  subsection consists of  coding sequences captured from patent
      applications.  A thorough  survey of  these  entries  have shown  that
      apart from a rather small minority  (which in  most cases have already
      been integrated in SWISS-PROT), most of these sequences contain either
      erroneous data or concern artificially generated sequences outside the
      scope of SWISS-PROT.

   4) Small fragments (Smalls.dat)
      Another  subsection  consists of fragments  with less than eight amino
      acids.

   5) CDS not coding for real proteins (Pseudo.dat)
      This subsection consists of CDS translations where we have strong
      evidence to believe that these CDS are not coding for real proteins.

   6) Truncated proteins (Truncated.dat)
      The last subsection consists of truncated proteins which result from
      events like mutations introducing a stop codon leading to the truncation
      of the protein product.


                4. Format Differences Between SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL

The format and conventions used by TrEMBL follow as closely as possible
that of SWISS-PROT. Hence, it is not necessary to produce an additional
user manual and extensive release notes for TrEMBL. The information given
in the SWISS-PROT release notes and user manual are in general valid for
TrEMBL. The differences are mentioned below.

The general structure of an entry is identical in SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL.
The data class used in TrEMBL (in the ID line) is always 'PRELIMINARY',
whereas in SWISS-PROT it is always 'STANDARD'.

Differences in line types present in SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL:

The ID line (IDentification):

The entry name used in SP-TrEMBL is the same as the Accession Number of the
entry. The entry name used in REM-TrEMBL is the stable part of the protein_id
tagged to the corresponding CDS in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database.
'protein_id' stands for the "Protein Identification" number. It is a number
that you will find in the feature table of the EMBL nucleotide sequence
entries in a qualifier called "/protein_id" which is tagged to every CDS.

Example:

FT   CDS             339..1514
FT                   /codon_start=1
FT                   /db_xref="PID:g1256015"
FT                   /product="dystrobrevin-epsilon"
FT                   /protein_id="AAC50431.1"

The protein_id is defined as follows in the The DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank Feature Table
Definition documentation
Qualifier          /protein_id
Definition         Protein Identifier, issued by International collaborators.
                   This qualifier consists of a stable ID portion (3+5 format
                   with 3 position letters and 5 numbers) plus a version
                   number after the decimal point.

Value format       &lt;identifier&gt;
Example            /protein_id="AAA12345.1"
Comment            When the protein sequence encoded by the CDS changes, only
                   the version number of the /protein_id value is incremented.
                   The stable part of the /protein_id remains unchanged and
                   as a result will permanently be associated with a given
                   protein. This qualifier is valid only on CDS features
                   which translate into a valid protein.


The DT line (DaTe)

The format of the DT lines that serve to indicate when an entry was
created and updated are identical to that defined in SWISS-PROT; but the
DT lines in TrEMBL refer to the TrEMBL release. The difference is
shown in the example below.

    DT lines in a SWISS-PROT entry:

    DT   01-JAN-1988 (Rel. 06, Created)
    DT   01-JUL-1989 (Rel. 11, Last sequence update)
    DT   01-AUG-1992 (Rel. 23, Last annotation update)

    DT lines in a TrEMBL entry:

    DT   01-NOV-1996 (TrEMBLrel. 01, Created)
    DT   01-NOV-1996 (TrEMBLrel. 01, Last sequence update)
    DT   01-FEB-1997 (TrEMBLrel. 02, Last annotation update)


                5. Weekly updates of TrEMBL and non-redundant data sets

Weekly cumulative updates of TrEMBL are available by anonymous FTP and
from the EBI SRS server.

We also produce every week a complete non-redundant protein sequence
collection by providing three compressed files (these are in the directory
/pub/databases/sp_tr_nrdb on the EBI FTP server and in databases/sp_tr_nrdb
on the ExPASy server): sprot.dat.Z, trembl.dat.Z and trembl_new.dat.Z.
This set of non-redundant files is especially important for two types of
users:

(i) Managers of similarity search services. They can now provide what is
currently the most comprehensive and non-redundant data set of protein
sequences.
(ii) Anybody wanting to update their full copy of SWISS-PROT + TrEMBL to
their own schedule without having to wait for full releases of SWISS-PROT
or of TrEMBL.
