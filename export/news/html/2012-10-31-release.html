   Life evolved in an anaerobic world
  </a>
  and it is thought that iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters played a crucial role in this process by facilitating chemical transformations. Once photosynthesis evolved, oxygen became prevalent, threatening Fe-S clusters as they are susceptible to destruction by oxidation. Despite this potential problem, Fe-S clusters are still cofactors in hundreds of

   proteins
  </a>
  . They are
  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22798587">
   required in virtually all organisms from bacteria to humans
  </a>
  and are involved not only in ‘redox’ catalysis in some enzymes, but also in many other functions. Interestingly, Fe-S clusters have been found in many proteins involved in
  <span class="caps">

  repair and replication and telomere length maintenance.
 </p>
 <p>
  In eukaryotic cells, most biosynthesis of Fe-S clusters occurs in the mitochondria, but it may also occur in the cytosol and nucleus. In the cytosol, Fe-S clusters are escorted and presented to their cytoplasmic and nuclear apoproteins by the conserved cytoplasmic iron-sulfur assembly (CIA) machinery. However, it is not clear how Fe-S clusters are transferred to target apoproteins, nor how target specificity is achieved.
