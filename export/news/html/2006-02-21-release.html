  Over 25'000 protein polymorphisms annotated in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
 </h3>
 <p>
  UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot pays a particular attention to the
    annotation of protein polymorphisms as well as disease mutations,
    due to their importance for the understanding of genetic diseases.
    Information on genetic variations and diseases is annotated in the
    comment section under the topic CC DISEASE and in the feature table
    using the key FT VARIANT. Literature reports used for data extraction
    are also cited in the entry, and data are manually checked prior to
    integration into the knowledgebase. Links to
  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/">
   OMIM
  </a>
  are provided
    whenever possible. As UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot is a 'proteocentric'
    resource, we do not annotate frameshifts or nonsense mutations as
    their deleterious effect on the protein is usually obvious. We
    therefore concentrate on tracking and storing data on amino acid
    substitutions, small deletions or insertions.
 </p>
 <p>
  We have currently reached a total of
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/docs/humpvar">
   25'255 variants in 4'196 human sequences
  </a>
  :
    98% of the variants are
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/docs/humsavar">
   single amino acid
  </a>
  polymorphisms (SAP).
    Association of a variant with a disease is annotated according to
    literature reports. In the current release, 13'581 SAPs are
    disease-associated, 9'451 are neutral polymorphisms and 1'816 are
    unclassified.

  The UniProtKB Sequence/Annotation Version Database (UniSave)
 </h3>
 <p>
  The introduction of more exact sequence and entry modification dates
    allowed us to introduce a new service:
    the
  <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/unisave/">
   <strong>
    UniProtKB Sequence/Annotation Version Database (UniSave)
   </strong>
  </a>
  is a comprehensive archive of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and
    UniProtKB/TrEMBL entry versions. Unlike the UniProt Knowledgebase, which
    contains only the latest Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL entry and sequence versions,
    the UniProtKB Sequence/Annotation Version Database provides access to
    all versions of these entries. This allows to track sequence changes, to
    find out when a given annotation appeared in an entry and how it evolved.
 </p>
 <p>
  All archived entry versions
    are available through the UniProtKB Sequence/Annotation Version Database in flat
    file and fasta format. Any two given entry versions can be compared to each other.
