  Annotation of TRPA1 and TRPM8 transient receptors involved in sensing cold
 </h3>
 <p>
  Mammals detect temperature with specialized neurons in the peripheral
     nervous system. Two transient receptor-class channels, TRPA1 and TRPM8,
      have been implicated in sensing cold.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first of these channels, TRPA1, is activated by temperatures
      below 17 degrees Celsius, which corresponds to the noxious cold
      threshold. The second channel, TRPM8, plays a role in sensing less
      extreme cool temperatures, being activated below 25 degrees Celsius.
 </p>
 <p>
  Interestingly, the TRPM8 channel is also activated by products such
       as eucalyptol or menthol, which may provide a ready explanation for
      the sensation of coolness triggered by these flavors.

  Changes in the RP (Reference Position) line
 </h3>
 <p>
  We changed the following items of the RP line:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   'SEQUENCE FROM N.A.' became '
   <strong>
    NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCE
   </strong>
   '
  </li>
  '
  This topic can be tagged with an optional qualifier indicating the
  origin of the sequence: '
  <strong>
   NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCE
  </strong>
  [ORIGIN OF SEQUENCE DATA]',
  where
  valid names are:
  <ul>
   <li>
    GENOMIC DNA: the individual gene has been sequenced
   </li>
   <li>
    GENOMIC RNA: the individual gene has been sequenced
   </li>
   <li>
    MRNA: the individual cDNA has been sequenced
   </li>
  </ul>
  If the data originates from a genome project or cDNA large-scale project, the
  qualifier is preceded by the term "LARGE SCALE"; this generally indicates that the relevant
  publication describes the project rather than giving further details on the protein of
  interest.
  <ul>
   <li>
    LARGE SCALE GENOMIC DNA: the gene has been sequenced as part of a genome project
   </li>
   <li>
    LARGE SCALE MRNA: the gene has been sequenced as part of a large-scale cDNA project
   </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
   'SEQUENCE' became '
   <strong>
    PROTEIN SEQUENCE
   </strong>
   '
  </li>
  <li>
   'REVISION(S)' became '
   <strong>
    SEQUENCE REVISION
   </strong>
   '
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Example:
 </p>
 <pre>
RP   NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCE [LARGE SCALE MRNA] (ISOFORM 1), PROTEIN SEQUENCE
RP   OF 108-131; 220-231 AND 349-393, CHARACTERIZATION, AND MUTAGENESIS OF
RP   ARG-336.

  New comment line (CC) topic: BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES
 </h3>
 <p>
  A new comment line (CC) topic has been introduced: BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES.
This topic is used to convey information relevant to biophysical and physicochemical
data and information on pH dependence, temperature dependence, kinetic parameters,
redox potentials, and maximal absorption.
 </p>
 <p>
  The format of this comment block is:
 </p>
 <pre>
CC   -!- BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES:
CC       Absorption:
CC         Abs(max)=xx nm;
CC         Note=free_text;
CC       Kinetic parameters:
CC         KM=xx unit for substrate [(free_text)];
CC         Vmax=xx unit enzyme [free_text];

 <p>
  A BIOPHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES block must contain at least one of the properties Absorption,
Kinetic parameters, pH dependence, Redox potential, Temperature dependence and may have any
combination of these properties (ordered as indicated above). The meaning of these subtopics
is as follows:
