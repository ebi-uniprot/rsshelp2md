  Complete human kinome in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot!
 </h3>
 <p>
  Phosphorylation by protein kinases is a universal and fundamental cell-signalling
      process in eukaryotic cells. A comprehensive catalog of predicted human kinases has
      been published in 2002
      (
  <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/298/5600/1912">
   Manning et al.
  </a>
  ).
 </p>
 <p>
  We have annotated the 518 protein kinases predicted to exist, and when necessary revised
      their sequences. The
  <a href="http://www.kinase.com/human/kinome/">
   human kinome
  </a>
  as defined
      by Manning et al., is now complete in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot !
 </p>
 <p>
  These protein kinases are subdivided in 10 groups
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   AGC (containing PKA, PKG and PKC families)
  </li>
  <li>
   CAMK (Calcium/Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase)
  </li>
  <li>
   CK1 (Casein kinase 1)
  </li>
  <li>
   CMGC (containing CDK, MAPK, GSK3  and CLK families)
  </li>
  <li>
   RGC (Receptor guanylate cyclases)
  </li>
  <li>
   STE (homologs of yeast Sterile 7, 11 and 20 kinases)
  </li>
  <li>
   TK (Tyrosine kinase)
  </li>
  <li>
   TKL (Tyrosine kinase-like)
  </li>
  <li>
   Atypical
  </li>
  <li>
   Other
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  In addition to these 518 protein kinases, there is currently one family of
      lipid kinases which is being fully characterized: the phosphatidyl 3-kinase
      (PI3 kinase) family (PI3 kinome). This emerging family appears to
      also include phosphatidyl 4-kinase (PI4 kinases). PI4 kinases as well as
      PI3 kinases share the same catalytic kinase domain. However, they are
      distantly related to the catalytic domain of the protein kinases and as a
      consequence belong to a separate family. This lipid kinase family will be
      soon integrated into UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mouse kinase orthologs are in the process of being all integrated into
      UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. By providing annotated and up-to-date human and
      mouse kinomes to the scientific community, our knowledgebase becomes a
      central and reference portal for kinases.
