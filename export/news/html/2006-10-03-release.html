  Over 1,000 rice proteins annotated
 </h3>
 <p>
  Rice (
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/4530">
   Oryza sativa
  </a>
  ) is the most
    important food crop in the world and part of the daily diet of
    over half of the human population. It is grown in 114 countries
    worldwide and provides 50-80% of the calory consumption in a
    number of Southeast Asian countries (see
  <a href="http://www.irri.org/science/ricestat/">
   world rice
    statistics
  </a>
  ).
 </p>
 <p>
  In the current release,
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy:4530+reviewed:yes">
   over
    1,000 rice entries
  </a>
  have been completed in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. How?
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the completion of the first genome sequence of the
    model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, in 2001 the Swiss-Prot group
    initiated the
  <a href="http://www.expasy.org/sprot/ppap/">
   Plant
    Proteome Annotation Program
  </a>
  , which focuses on the annotation
    of plant-specific proteins and protein families. Our major
    effort was directed towards Arabidopsis, but the completion of
    the Oryza sativa (cultivar Nipponbare) genome sequence by the
  <a href="http://rgp.dna.affrc.go.jp/IRGSP/">
   IRGSP
  </a>
  prompted
    us to broaden our focus.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each manually annotated rice entry already contains the TIGR
    locus identifiers - which map each protein to the corresponding
    gene in the rice genome - and will soon also include RAP loci.
    Amongst the numerous cross-references in rice entries is the
    link to
  <a href="http://www.gramene.org/">
   Gramene
  </a>
  which
    gives access to comparative grass genomics. We also plan to link
    our entries to
  <a href="http://rapdb.lab.nig.ac.jp/">
   RAP-DB
  </a>
  in the near future, which will provide links to genomic data and
    genome annotation.
 </p>
 <p>
  We are currently concentrating on the annotation of
    well-characterized proteins for which experimental data are
    available. The function of a number of rice proteins reflects
    physiological trait adaptation and grain property evolution
    owing to centuries of selection by farmers (over 100,000 rice
    varieties exist throughout the world).
 </p>
 <p>
  As an example, large areas of Southeast Asia are flooded
    during the monsoon season. Deepwater rice copes with this by way
    of rapid internode elongation (up to 25 cm/day), and
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P93442">
   expansin A4
  </a>
  contributes by causing
    the cell walls to slacken and expand.
 </p>
 <p>
  What is more, a primary factor that decreases rice crop yield
    is coastal salinity and the accumulation of salts in irrigated
    land. Pokkali, an indica variety of lowland rice, is classified
    as highly tolerant, because it contains a specific potassium-sodium
    cotransporter (
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q93XI5">
   HKT2
  </a>
  ), which mediates
    increased potassium uptake with external sodium accumulation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, grain texture of cooked rice is essential in various
    food cultures. A generic classification exists between long grain,
    medium grain and short grain rice, where the first is separate and
    fluffy and the last more moist, sticky and tender. The proportion
    of long chain amylopectin is correlated with firmer cooked rice.
    A starch synthase (
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q5DWW9">
   SSII-3
  </a>
  ), which
    synthesizes long chain amylopectin, is barely active in the sticky
    cultivar japonica Nipponbare, however, a variation of 4 amino acids
    leads to an increased activity in firmer indica varieties.
 </p>
 <p>
  All rice proteins annotated in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot are
    classified by chromosome locus (ordered locus name starting with
    "Os") and listed in the file
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/docs/rice">
   rice.txt
  </a>
  .
    In the future, we plan to manually annotate every rice gene family
    and to develop semi-automated annotation tools to complete rice
    proteome annotation.
