  UniPathway, a metabolic door to UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
 </h3>
 <p>
  Due to the importance of using standardized nomenclature, annotations in
      UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot are progressively moving towards structured controlled
      vocabularies. In this context, the
  <a href="http://www.grenoble.prabi.fr/obiwarehouse/unipathway">
   UniPathway
  </a>
  project (a collaborative project involving the
  <a href="http://www.isb-sib.ch/">
   SIB
  </a>
  and
  <a href="http://www.inrialpes.fr/">
   INRIA
  </a>
  ) aims at
      providing an extra resource dedicated to the exploration of metabolism using
      a structured controlled vocabulary for concisely describing the role of a protein
      in metabolism.
 </p>
 <p>
  The metabolism of living organisms can be understood as a network of
      biochemical reactions, generally catalyzed by enzymes. Dealing with
      this network as a whole is a complex task and a classical approach is to divide it
      into more manageable segments, called pathways. This approach is always somewhat
      arbitrary and depends upon the final usage. Usually, a first level of
      segmentation is achieved on the basis of biological criteria. For instance,
      one could divide by considering the sub-network of all reactions involved in the amino-acid biosynthesis
      or, more specifically, in L-lysine biosynthesis only, or even more
      specifically, in L-lysine biosynthesis via the AAA pathway. It results in
      a series of coarse- to fine-grained divisions (the coarsest is called a
      'super-pathway').
 </p>
 <p>
  Whenever possible, we further refine this first-level segmentation to
      a second-level one, in order to split the pathways into linear
      segments (i.e. sub-networks without branches) called 'sub-pathways'.
      Such a fine-grained segmentation allows representation of pathway
      variants. Indeed, depending on an organism (or a set of organisms),
      the chemical route from one compound to another can be performed in
      different ways. It is important to represent these variations within
      the same pathway since UniProtKB covers a large number of species. In
      addition, it offers a convenient way to label the enzymatic reactions
      that constitute a metabolic pathway by their relative position
      ('step') in the sub-pathway.
 </p>
 <p>
  The role of a protein in metabolism is described in the 'Pathway' subsection of the
      'General annotation (Comments)' section. The syntax is 'super-pathway; pathway; sub-pathway: step n/m'.
      For examples of metabolic pathway annotations, see:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P49367#section_comments">

  </a>
  and
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P11454#section_comments">
   P11454
  </a>
  . In this last example, the biochemical
      reactions of the pathway are not yet known.
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P11454#section_comments">
   P11454

  was therefore only annotated at the level of the pathway.

  In the current version of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, close to
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=annotation:(type:pathway)+AND+reviewed:yes">
   82'000 entries
  </a>
  are
      annotated with the UniPathway controlled vocabulary. The UniProt web site
      supplies direct links to the
  <a href="http://www.grenoble.prabi.fr/obiwarehouse/unipathway">
   UniPathway
  </a>
  web server that provides more detailed information on pathways, sub-pathways and biochemical reactions.

  Syntax modification of the 'Pathway' subsection
 </h2>
 <p>
  We have structured the 'Pathway' subsection of the 'General annotation (Comments)' section
      (comment line (CC) topic PATHWAY in the flat file), using the controlled vocabulary provided by the
  <a href="http://www.grenoble.prabi.fr/obiwarehouse/unipathway">
   UniPathway
  </a>
  resource, in order to improve the consistency of annotation and to allow to
      parse its content.
 </p>
 <p>
  The new format of PATHWAY topic in the flat file is:
 </p>
 <pre>
CC   -!- PATHWAY: <em>Super-pathway</em>; <em>Pathway</em>(; <em>Sub-pathway</em>: <em>Enzymatic_reaction</em>)?([regulation])?.
     </pre>
 Where:
 <ul>
  <li>
   <em>
    Super-pathway
   </em>
   : Describes a class of metabolic pathways, e.g.
   <code>
    Amino-acid biosynthesis
   </code>
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Pathway
   </em>
   : Describes a metabolic pathway, e.g.
   <code>
    L-lysine biosynthesis via AAA pathway
   </code>
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Sub-pathway
   </em>
   : Describes a linear sequence of enzymatic reactions in the format:
   <br/>
   <em>
    final_product
   </em>
   from
   <em>
    initial_substrate
   </em>
   <br/>
   where
   <em>
    final_product
   </em>
   and
   <em>
    initial_substrate
   </em>
   are the labels of the corresponding chemical compounds, e.g.
   <code>
    L-alpha-aminoadipate from 2-oxoglutarate
   </code>
  </li>
  <li>
   <em>
    Enzymatic_reaction
   </em>
   : Describes the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by the protein in the format:
   <br/>
   step
   <em>
    n
   </em>
   /
   <em>
    m
   </em>
   <br/>
   where
   <em>
    n
   </em>
   is the relative position of the enzymatic reaction in the sub-pathway and
   <em>
    m
   </em>
   is the total number of enzymatic reactions in the sub-pathway.
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    [regulation]
   </code>
   : Indicates that a protein acts as transcriptional regulator of the genes coding for enzymes of the pathway.
  </li>
 </ul>

      parentheses) is optional.
