  The dramatic outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus may be due to two mutations in the virus spike protein
 </h3>
 <p>
  The
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/227859">
   SARS coronavirus
  </a>
  is a new human pathogen that emerged in Asia in
        2002-2003. The animal reservoir of the virus is presumably
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/9675">
   palm civet
  </a>
  ,
        whose meat is a delicacy in Southern China.
 </p>
 <p>
  The virus induces an acute respiratory distress in human and is deadly in 10% of all cases.
        It enters pulmonary cells through binding of the viral spike protein
        (human isolate Tor2 and palm civet isolate SZ3:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P59594">
   P59594
  </a>
  ) to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (palm civet:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q56NL1">
   Q56NL1
  </a>
  ;
        human:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9BYF1">
   Q9BYF1
  </a>
  ).
        These proteins have recently been annotated or updated in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.
 </p>
 <p>
  It has been recently shown that  two amino acid mutations on palm civet
        SARS spike protein, Lys-479 and Ser-487, are sufficient for the virus
        to acquire the ability to bind efficiently human ACE2  (see EMBO J.
        24:1634-1643(2005); PubMed:
  <a href="http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15791205">
   15791205
  </a>
  ).
 </p>
 <p>
  The severity of the 2002-2003 epidemic was presumably due to those two
        amino-acid mutations, giving opportunity to an animal virus to cause a
        major infection in the human species.
