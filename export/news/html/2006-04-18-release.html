  The ComX pheromone
 </h3>
 <p>
  ComX, a pheromone involved in a major quorum sensing system in
    bacilli, is post-translationally modified by strain-specific prenylation.
 </p>
 <p>
  In order to acquire genetic competence once the cell density
    has reached a critical threshold, bacteria have developed a
    sophisticated quorum-sensing system. This system proceeds through
    the release of a pheromone,
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q8VL79">
   comX
  </a>
  ,
    that activates a two-component system, which eventually propagates
    the signal into the cell. Both components of this system have
    been identified: they are the sensor histidine kinase,
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q99027">
   comP
  </a>
  , and the response regulator,
    the transcription factor
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P14204">
   comA
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The crucial pheromone ComX is produced as an inactive precursor
    which is activated by 2 post-translational modifications (PTM):
    the prenylation of a conserved tryptophan residue and a proteolytic
    cleavage. The protein
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P33690">
   comQ
  </a>
  is
    thought to catalyze the maturation
    of comX. ComX and comQ sequences show striking variability among
    different strains, as do the prenyl derivatives. The mass of the
    prenyl groups linked to comX has been determined by mass spectrometry.
    Surprisingly, three different masses were observed: 120Da, 136Da
    and 205Da, depending on the strain studied. The 136 and 205Da
    forms are thought to consist of farnesyl and geranyl groups,
    respectively. The
  <a href="http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16407988">
   structure
    of the 205Da prenyl group
  </a>
  in strain W23/RO-E-2 was recently
    obtained (
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q8VL79">
   Q8VL79
  </a>
  ). It consists of a
    geranyl group bound to a cyclic tryptophan. Interestingly enough,
    the nature of the prenyl group was shown to depend on the comX
    sequence itself rather than on the origin of the modifying enzyme
    comQ.
 </p>
 <p>
  To our knowledge, this is the first report of a post-translational
    prenylation catalyzed by a bacterial enzyme, despite the universal
    availability of the necessary isoprenoid substrates and the existence
    of various other lipid-modified proteins in this kingdom. The exact
    function of comX prenylation is not known, but, by analogy with
    the situation in eukaryotes, it may provide anchoring to membrane
    structures.

  Changes in the tisslist.txt file

 <p>
  The
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/docs/tisslist">
   tisslist.txt
  </a>
  file lists the tissues that are used in the "TISSUE" topic of the
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/manual/references">
   references
  </a>
  of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries.
    It has been changed in the following way:
 </p>
 <p>
  Each term in the list has an accession number and optionally further
    relevant information such as synonyms and mappings to
  <a href="http://www.evocontology.org/">
   eVOC
  </a>
  terms.
    eVOC contains four ontologies - Anatomical system, Cell type, Developmental
    stage, Pathology - which provide appropriate sets of detailed terms that
    describe the sample source of human experimental material such as cDNA and SAGE
    libraries.
