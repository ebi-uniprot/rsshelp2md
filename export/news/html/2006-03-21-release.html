  Chikungunya virus annotation
 </h3>
 <p>
  The Chikungunya virus has made a severe outbreak in French
    island of Reunion and also in Mauritius, Seychelles, Mayotte and
    Madagascar, all located off the southeast coast of Africa. The
    virus is not deadly, but causes severe fever, rash, arthritis and
    joint pain. These symptoms are at the origin of the name Chikungunya,
    which means in Swahili "that which bends up".
 </p>
 <p>
  The virus belongs to the large family of Togaviridae, genus
    Alphavirus. This family includes exotic viruses like O'nyong nyong
    and Igba Oro, which are very closely related to Chikungunya and
    induce actually the same disease in humans. Interestingly, the
    name O'nyong nyong comes from the Nilotic language of Uganda and
    Sudan and means "weakening of the joints".
 </p>
 <p>
  Chikungunya is transmitted by mosquitos, in which it infects
    salivary glands, but the natural host reservoir is constituted of
    different types of monkeys.
 </p>
 <p>
  The molecular strategy used by Alphaviruses to replicate and
    hijack cellular defense is very surprising:
 </p>
 <p>
  After virus entry into the target cell, the mRNA(+) genome is
    translated into a
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q8JUX6">
   nonstructural
    polyprotein
  </a>
  , which starts discretely to replicate the genome
    in the cytoplasm. After this early phase where the virus avoids
    cellular defense by restraining its activity, the nonstructural
    polyprotein is processed into four proteins. There goes the virus
    at full strength to replicate large amount of his genome, and
    innocently transcribes also a subgenomic 26S RNA. This replication
    has a drawback: it creates dsRNA by genome and antigenome
    hybridization.
 </p>
 <p>
  No eukaryotic cell can accept such an offence: dsRNA is a
    signature of viral infection. The host cell reacts violently:
    human PKR is strongly activated by the dsRNA, resulting in a
    complete shutoff of cellular translation through inactivation of
    early initiation of translation factor EIF2A.
 </p>
 <p>
  But this powerful cellular defense was expected by the virus.
    The 26S mRNA possesses a unique feature in biology: an enhancer
    element which allows the mRNA to be translated independently of
    EIF2A. This 26S RNA codes for the
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q8JUX5">
   structural
    proteins
  </a>
  , which are now the only proteins synthesized by the
    cell! These structural proteins form new virions which bud from
    the doomed cell to find new targets.
