  Annotation of HERV protein sequences
 </h3>
 <p>
  The human genome contains a number of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs).
     These proviruses (the integrated form of retroviral DNA) are retroviral
     sequences that are transmitted vertically as part of the host germ line. A
     number of HERV 'families' have been identified, each derived from an
     independent colonisation event.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some proviruses display open reading frames with coding capacity for a variety
      of viral-like proteins (Env, Gag, Pol, Pro, etc.). We have already annotated in
      Swiss-Prot a significant number of HERV proteins. We only include such
      potential proteins if they are meeting one of these three criteria: i) if there
      is evidence of their expression by the host, ii) if the derived sequence
      encodes a full-length protein, iii) if the protein has a potential cellular
      function.

  Change in the keyword line (KW)
 </h3>
 <p>
  Keywords are now stored by alphabetical order on the KW lines of both
Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL entries.
 </p>
 <h3>
  Format change in the comment line (CC) topic: MASS SPECTROMETRY
 </h3>
 <p>
  We have slightly changed the format for the comment line topic
MASS SPECTROMETRY, which reports the exact molecular weight of a protein or
part of a protein as determined by mass spectrometric methods.
The modifications concern the topic RANGE, which has become mandatory,
and the introduction of the new mandatory topic NOTE, which is used
to indicate the relevant reference number.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   New format:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <pre>
CC   -!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=XXX[; MW_ERR=XX][; METHOD=XX]; RANGE=XX-XX[ (Name)]; NOTE={Free text (Ref.n)|Ref.n}.
</pre>
 <p>
  Where:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   'MW=XXX' is the determined molecular weight (MW);
  </li>
  <li>
   'MW_ERR=XX' (optional) is the accuracy or error range of the MW measurement;
  </li>
  <li>
   'METHOD=XX' (optional) is the ionization method;
  </li>
  <li>
   'RANGE=XX-XX[ (Name)]' (mandatory)
  is used to indicate what part of the protein sequence entry corresponds to the molecular weight.
  In case of multiple products, the name of the relevant isoform is enclosed.
  </li>
  <li>
   'NOTE={Free text (Ref.n)|Ref.n}' (mandatory) indicates the relevant reference, which optionally
 can be preceded by a comment in free text format.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Example:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <pre>
CC   -!- MASS SPECTROMETRY: MW=32875.93; METHOD=MALDI;
CC       RANGE=1-284 (Isoform 3); NOTE=Ref.6.

  Changes concerning the

 <p>
  We are continuously overhauling the annotation of post-translational modifications (PTMs).
For the feature key
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/manual/mod_res">
   MOD_RES

  , the new introduced
controlled vocabularies for PTMs
are:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    Hydroxylation: All entries with annotated hydroxylation sites have the keyword
    <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-0379">
     Hydroxylation

    .
   </p>
   <dl>
