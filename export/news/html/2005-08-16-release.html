  Integration of data from an enzyme genomics project
 </h3>
 <p>
  We have integrated into UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot the results of Aled Edwards' and Alexander Yakunin's group
        which were summarized in FEMS Microbiology Reviews 29:263-279 (2005) (PubMed:
  <a href="http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15808744">
   15808744
  </a>
  ). Using general enzymatic
        assays to screen individually purified proteins for enzymatic activity, they have identified
        activity for 36 previously uncharacterized proteins of
  <em>
   E.coli, T. maritima, T. acidophilum,
          M. jannaschii
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   P. aeruginosa
  </em>
  .

  The sequencing of complete genomes produce increasing number of CDSs which are annotated as
        "hypothetical proteins". Approximately 40% of the protein sequences deposited in databases
        do not have any characterized function. This hinders the progress and research in many areas
        ranging from genome annotation to metabolic engineering. It is therefore of fundamental
        importance to carry on with experimental verification of function of these proteins, and, equally
        important, to integrate the results into the database. One of the major priorities in Swiss-Prot
        is to be up-to-date with respect to this kind of new findings, and we strive to integrate new
        characterizations as quickly as possible. We urge all groups obtaining these results to submit
        update requests to us. We will treat these requests with the highest priority.
