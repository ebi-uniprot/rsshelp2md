  6 million entries in UniProtKB
 </h3>
 <p>
  Once upon a long, long time... This is how all fairy tales start, but was it
      really so long ago? No, it was December 2003 - just 4 and a half years ago, but
      it seems like ages - that UniProtKB was born. It was a beautiful baby, 1,220,020
      entries fat and well supported by its 2 legs: the large TrEMBL and the small
      but knowledgeable Swiss-Prot. And the baby put on weight: on average 1,500
      protein sequence entries per day in 2004 and during the first half of 2005. The
      more you have, the more you want, and from the middle of 2005 up to beginning of
      2007, UniProtKB was integrating about 3,500 new entries per day. And it hasn't
      stopped since: currently we are integrating approximately 5,000 entries per day and this number keeps growing.
      As a result, we are happy to announce that UniProtKB has reached the
      significant milestone of 6,074,524 entries. Note that this tremendous growth is
      not due to the submission of environmental samples that are stored in another
      UniProt database: UniMES.

 <p>
  May we all live happily ever after and extract knowledge from this flood of
      data!

 <p>
  Cross-references have been added to the
  <a href="http://www.nmpdr.org/">
   National Microbial Pathogen Data Resource
  </a>
  . NMPDR is a National Institute
     of Allergy and Infections Disease (NIAID)-funded Bioinformatics Resource Center
     that supports research in selected Category B pathogens. NMPDR contains the
     complete genomes of approximately 50 strains of pathogenic bacteria as well
     as &gt;400 other genomes that provide a broad context for comparative analysis
     across the three phylogenetic domains. NMPDR integrates complete, public genomes
     with expertly curated biological subsystems to provide the most consistent
     genome annotations. Subsystems are sets of functional roles related by a
     biologically meaningful organizing principle, which are built over large
     collections of genomes; they provide researchers with consistent functional
     assignments in a biologically structured context.
