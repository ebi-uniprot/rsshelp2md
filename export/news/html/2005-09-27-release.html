  10'000 mouse entries
 </h3>
 <p>
  The threshold of
  <a href="http://www.expasy.org/sprot/hpi/hpi_stat.html#mouse">
   10'000 mouse entries
  </a>
  is about to be reached in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.
35% of them contain information
about isoforms generated by alternative splicing. When these are taken into
account, the total number of mouse sequences in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot is close to
13'000. The second most represented rodent is UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot is rat with
about 4'600 entries.
 </p>
 <p>
  The majority of the mouse entries contain sequence data generated by one
of the two high-throughput cDNA sequencing projects: the
  <a href="http://mgc.nci.nih.gov/">
   NIH Mammalian
Gene Collection (MGC)
  </a>
  and the
  <a href="http://genome.gsc.riken.go.jp/">
   RIKEN
  </a>
  (Rikagaku
Kenkyusho, Institute of Physical and Chemical Research) mouse full-length
cDNA encyclopedia.  97% of the
entries also include cross-references to the
  <a href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/">
   Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI)
database
  </a>
  which provides access to
additional data on the genetics, genomics and biology of the laboratory
mouse.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our aim is to annotate all mouse proteins along with the orthologous
sequences in other mammals, especially homo sapiens, in order to provide
a complete and comprehensive view of mammalian proteomes.

  Annotation changes concerning the feature key METAL
 </h3>
 <p>
  The feature key METAL describes the binding of metal ions.
    More than 1 metal ion could be listed in the description field, when
    more than one ion binds to the same sequence residue.
    We have now restricted the annotation to only
    1 metal ion per FT METAL line. Example:
 </p>
 <pre>
FT   METAL        61     61       Copper and zinc.
</pre>
 <p>
  became:
 </p>
 <pre>
FT   METAL        61     61       Copper.
FT   METAL        61     61       Zinc.
</pre>
