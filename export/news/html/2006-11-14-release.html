  CD antigens: molecular markers of cell differentiation
 </h3>
 <p>
  The
  <a href="http://hcdm.org/MoleculeInformation/tabid/54/Default.aspx">
   CD nomenclature
  </a>
  was proposed and
     established in 1982 at the first International Workshop and Conference on Human
     Leukocyte Differentiation Antigens (HLDA). This system was intended for the
     classification of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), generated in many laboratories
     around the world, against various cell surface molecules on leukocytes (white
     blood cells). The data were collated and analyzed by the statistical procedure
     of 'cluster analysis'. This analytical method identified clusters of antibodies
     with very similar patterns of binding to leukocytes at various stages of
     differentiation: hence the use of the abbreviation 'CD' for 'cluster of
     differentiation'. CD antibodies are used widely for research, differential
     diagnosis, and the monitoring and treatment of disease.
 </p>
 <p>
  The HLDA workshops assign each CD on the basis of the reactivity of at least two
     mAbs to one human antigen; the provisional indicator 'w' (for example
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/O00238">
   CDw293
  </a>
  ) is sometimes given to an imperfectly
     characterized cluster or to a cluster represented by only one mAb.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gradually the use of the CD nomenclature has expanded to many other cell types
     such as endothelial and stromal cells. Therefore the 8th HLDA conference (HDLA8)
     decided in 2004 that the acronym HLDA would be replaced by HCDM for "Human Cell
     Differentiation Molecules".
 </p>
 <p>
  All
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/docs/cdlist">
   currently defined human CD antigens
  </a>
  (a total of 361 in this release) are annotated and integrated
     in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. A CD antigen appears in an entry as
     a synonym of the protein name (e.g.
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q6GTX8">
   CD305 antigen
  </a>
  for Leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor 1).
     The CD name is also propagated to all orthologous mammalian
     proteins, so that human CD antigens and their orthologs in other mammals can be
     retrieved easily.

  Extension of the UniProtKB accession number format
 </h3>
 <p>
  Before release 9.1, UniProtKB accession numbers consisted of 6 alphanumerical
     characters in the following format:
 </p>
 <table summary="Swiss-Prot accession number">
  <tr>
   <th>
    1
   </th>
   <th>
    2
   </th>
   <th>
    3
   </th>
   <th>
    4
   </th>
   <th>
    5
   </th>
   <th>
    6
   </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    [O,P,Q]
   </td>
   <td>
    [0-9]
   </td>
   <td>
    [A-Z, 0-9]
   </td>
   <td>
    [A-Z, 0-9]
   </td>
   <td>
    [A-Z, 0-9]
   </td>
   <td>
    [0-9]
   </td>
  </tr>
 </table>
 <p>
  Due to the large increase in the number of protein sequences in UniProtKB, we
     had to extend the existing accession number format by allowing the first
     character to be any of the 26 letters (instead of only O, P and Q). To avoid
     assigning accession numbers identical to those which have been used by the
     International Nucleotide Sequence Database, the extension in the first position
     goes along with a restriction in the third position which can only be a
     letter. The new format for UniProtKB accession numbers is therefore:
 </p>
 <table summary="Swiss-Prot accession number">

     combines detailed drug (i.e. chemical, pharmacological and pharmaceutical) data with comprehensive drug
     target (i.e. sequence, structure, and pathway) information. The database contains many drug entries
     including FDA-approved small molecule drugs, FDA-approved biotech (protein/peptide) drugs, nutraceuticals
     and experimental drugs. Additionally, protein (i.e. drug target) sequences are linked to these drug entries.
     Each DrugCard entry contains more than 80 data fields with half of the information being devoted to drug/chemical
     data and the other half devoted to drug target or protein data.
