  4,000 bovine entries in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot

 <p>
  UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot is happy to announce the annotation of
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=organism:9913+reviewed:yes">
   over 4,000 entries
  </a>
  of a very popular animal in Switzerland, almost a national symbol:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/9913">
   Bos taurus
  </a>
  , in other words, the cow.
 </p>
 <p>
  Those of you who have visited the Swiss Alps may know that their gorgeous scenery is
      definitely associated with the sound of cowbells in summer pasture. Similarly,
      the modern biology landscape would be poorer without bovine sequences,
      obviously not in a decorative role, but as a key element for our understanding
      of human biology.
 </p>

  The domesticated cow is extensively used in biomedical research, as an animal
      model and also as a source of biological material. Remember that
      bovine insulin was the first sequenced protein and was used for decades to
      treat diabetes. The first draft of the bovine genome sequence was released in
      October 2004 by the Human Genome Sequencing Center of the Baylor College of
      Medicine. The human and bovine genomes are more similarly organized than
      when either is compared to the mouse. Despite its interest, only a few large scale
      cDNA sequencing projects have been initiated. Currently more than 70% of the
      UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot bovine sequences come from translation of cDNA
      sequences produced the NIH

   Mammalian Gene Collection

     PeptideAtlas is a multi-organism, publicly accessible compendium of peptides
     that have been identified in a large set of tandem mass spectrometry proteomics
     experiments. All results of sequence searching have subsequently been processed
     through PeptideProphet to derive a probability of correct identification for all
     results in a uniform manner to insure a high quality database. All peptides have
     been mapped to Ensembl and can be viewed as custom tracks on the Ensembl Genome Browser.

     The Database of Protein Disorder (DisProt) is a curated database that provides
     information about proteins that lack fixed 3D structure in their putatively native states,
     either in their entirety or in part. DisProt is a collaborative effort between
     Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at Indiana University School of
     Medicine and Center for Information Science and Technology at Temple University.
