  New insights into drug development with Polyketide synthases
 </h3>
 <p>
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyketide">
   Polyketides
  </a>
  are secondary
      metabolites produced by numerous organisms, from bacteria, fungi and plants to animals.
      Polyketides are structurally very diverse, thousands of different polyketides have already
      been discovered, and they possess a wealth of biological activities, including antimicrobial,
      antifungal and antiparasitic functions. They endow their producing organism with
  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12970466,10972818">
   increased fitness
  </a>
  in
      an environment full of competitors. And not only the producers! We also take
      advantage of these compounds and many are in commercial use as natural insecticides,
      cholesterol-lowering agents, antitumor drugs or immunosuppressors.

  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyketide">
   Polyketides
  </a>
  are
      synthesized by an important family of enzymes, called
  <a href="http://en. wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyketide_synthase">
   polyketide synthases
  </a>
  (PKSs). PKSs are large
      multifunctional proteins, with an average length of over 2'500 amino acids, up to almost
      5'000 amino acids, often bearing several different catalytic activities. Polyketide
      biosynthesis proceeds by the assembly of simple blocks, such as propionyl-CoA, butyryl-CoA or acetyl-CoA, in a process that closely parallels fatty acid biosynthesis. The
      fascinating diversity of polyketides arises through various mechanisms: use of different
      starter molecules, different chain extension substrates, generation of chiral centers,
      functional group modifications, such as cyclization, etc.

  The social amoeba
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictyostelium_discoideum">
   <em>
    Dictyostelium discoideum
   </em>
  </a>
  lives in the soil
      and feeds on a variety of bacteria and fungi. In its natural habitat,
  <em>
   D.
       discoideum
  </em>
  has several rivals, such as bacteria, nematodes, and
  <em>
   Dictyostelium
        caveatum
  </em>
  . However, this slime mold is not defenseless and it has been shown, for instance, to be able to
  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8643493">
   repel nematodes
  </a>
  "by secreting
      compounds". It appears today that
  <em>
   D. discoideum
  </em>
  has at least 40 functional PKS
      genes and 5 probable pseudogenes. This is the
  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17660200,18252726">
   largest number of PKSs
  </a>
  of all known genomes.
 </p>
 <p>
  These proteins are very interesting. Understanding the exact
      enzymatic mechanisms in play and the role of each PKS module in the generation of
      polyketide diversity may allow us to engineer new PKSs that could produce new active
      compounds. The way may be paved for the discovery of fundamentally new types of drugs!
