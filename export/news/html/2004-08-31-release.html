  1'500 cited journals
 </h3>
 <p>
  It is interesting to note that information relevant to the scope of
     Swiss-Prot is found in a continuously increasing number of
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/docs/jourlist">
   scientific journals
  </a>
  . Currently Swiss-Prot cites
      1'500 different journals. Only 5 years
     ago, this number was slightly less than 1'000. Out of those 1'500 journals,
     157 are either no longer published or have changed their names. It is also
     noteworthy that about 50% of these 1'500 journals are only cited less than
     four times in the knowledgebase. At the other extreme, only 106 journals
      are cited more than 100 times.
