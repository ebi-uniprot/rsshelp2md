   1.2  Source of data

   Release 17.0  has been  updated using protein sequence data from release
   26.0 of  the PIR (Protein Identification Resource) protein data bank, as
   well as translation of nucleotide sequence data from release 25.0 of the
   EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Data Library.

   As an  indication to  the source  of the sequence data in the SWISS-PROT
   data bank  we list  here the  statistics  concerning  the  DR  (Databank
   Reference) pointer lines:

   Entries with pointer(s) to only PIR entri(es):           3752
   Entries with pointer(s) to only EMBL entri(es):          3713
   Entries with pointer(s) to both EMBL and PIR entri(es): 12112
   Entries with no pointers lines:                           447




      2. DESCRIPTION OF THE CHANGES MADE TO SWISS-PROT SINCE RELEASE 16


   2.1  Sequences and annotations

   About 1700 sequences have been added since release 16, the sequence data
   of 312  existing entries  has been  updated and  the annotations of 3750
   entries have  been revised.  In particular we have used reviews articles
   to update  the annotations  of  the  following  groups  or  families  of
   proteins:

   -  6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase
   -  Aconitase
   -  Alpha-2 macroglobulin family
   -  ATP synthase a subunit
   -  Catalases
   -  Chalcone resveratrol synthases
   -  Citrate synthase
   -  Dihydroorotase
   -  DNA polymerase family A
   -  Eukaryotic cobalamin-binding proteins
   -  Fatty acid desaturases
   -  Fungal  Zn(2)-Cys(6)   binuclear   cluster   domain   transcriptional
      activators
   -  Gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase
   -  Glutamine amidotransferases class-I
   -  Glutamine amidotransferases class-II
   -  Gonadotropin-releasing hormones
   -  Guanylate cyclases
   -  LIM-1 domain proteins
   -  Myotoxins
   -  Nucleoside diphosphate kinases
   -  Pathogenesis-related proteins BetvI family
   -  Peroxidases
   -  Polyprenyl synthetases
   -  Ribosomal proteins
   -  Rotamases (cyclophilin and FKBP)
   -  Small cytokines (PF4/IL-8 and MCAF/MIP-1 subfamilies)
   -  Sodium symporters
   -  Thiol-activated cytolysins


   2.2 Status of cross-references to PIR

   Older releases of SWISS-PROT contained cross-references to entries which
   were present  only in  the annotated  section of PIR (currently known as
   PIR1); we  started adding cross-references to entries in the unannotated
   sections of PIR (known as PIR2 and PIR3).



                            3. FORTHCOMING CHANGES

   3.1  New line-types: RC and RP

   We plan  to implement the following change in release 19; the current RN
   line will  be replaced  by three  line types:  a modified  RN (Reference
   Number) line  type containing  just  the  reference  number,  a  new  RC
   (Reference Comment)  line  type  containing  comments  relevant  to  the
   reference (strain, tissue, etc.), and a new RP (Reference Position) line
   type containing  the extent of the sequencing carried out by the authors
   of the  reference. Three  examples of  the usage  of these new lines are
   given below.

      RN   [1]
      RC   STRAIN=K12;
      RP   SEQUENCE FROM N.A., AND SEQUENCE OF 1-23.

      RN   [1]
      RC   STRAIN=BALB/C; TISSUE=BRAIN;
      RP   SEQUENCE OF 24-56 AND 67-89.

      RN   [2]
      RC   X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHY=1.8 ANGSTROMS;


   Each reference  block will continue to have exactly one RN line. As many
   RC lines  as are  needed to display the reference's comment will appear.
   If a  reference has no comment then the RC line will not appear. As many
   RP lines  as are  needed to display the extent of sequencing carried out
   by the  authors of  the reference.  If  a  reference  does  not  pertain
   directly to sequencing data then the RP line will not appear.

   3.2  New line-types: CA and CF

   As we announced in the last two release notes, starting with release 18,
   the enzyme entries in SWISS-PROT will have two new line-types:

      CA   Description_of_catalytic_activity.
      CF   Description_of_cofactor.

   These lines  will be  automatically generated  at each release of SWISS-
   PROT from  the information  stored in  the ENZYME  data bank.  They will
   replace the  'CATALYTIC ACTIVITY`  and 'COFACTORS`  comment  lines  (CC)
   topics. Example:

      CC   -!- CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: L-ASPARTATE + 2-OXOGLUTARATE =
               OXALOACETATE + L-GLUTAMATE.
      CC   -!- COFACTOR: PYRIDOXAL PHOSPHATE.

   will be changed to:

      CA   L-ASPARTATE + 2-OXOGLUTARATE = OXALOACETATE + L-GLUTAMATE.
      CF   PYRIDOXAL PHOSPHATE.



   3.3  Change in the OS line

   As we announced in the last two release notes, starting with release 18,
   we will invert the order of the information in the OS line. Currently we
   have 'English  common name  (Latin name)`, we will switch to 'Latin name
   (English common name)`. Example:

      OS   HUMAN (HOMO SAPIENS).

   will be changed to:

      OS   HOMO SAPIENS (HUMAN).


                            4. ENZYME AND PROSITE

   4.1  The ENZYME data bank

   Release 4.0 of the ENZYME data bank is distributed along with release 17
   of SWISS-PROT.  ENZYME release 4.0 contains information relative to 3072
   enzymes. The  data bank  is complete  and up  to date.  Until new enzyme
   nomenclature data  is published  we only  plan to  update the SWISS-PROT
   pointers at  each release  of the  protein sequence  data bank,  correct
   eventual errors,  and complete  the information  concerning synonyms and
   cofactors using the literature.

   4.2  The PROSITE data bank

   Release 6.1  of the  PROSITE data bank is distributed along with release
   17 of  SWISS-PROT. PROSITE  release 6.1  does not really represent a new
   release; the  only changes  between release 6.0 and 6.1 are  updating of
   the pointers  to the  SWISS-PROT entries  whose name  have been modified
   between release  16 and  17. The  next release  of PROSITE (7.0) will be
   distributed with release 18.0 of SWISS-PROT.


                            5. WE NEED YOUR HELP !

   We welcome  feedback from our users. We would especially appreciate that
   you notify  us if  you find  that sequences  belonging to  your field of
   expertise are  missing from  the data  bank. We  also would  like to  be
   notified about annotations to be updated, as for example if the function
   of a protein has been clarified or if new post-translational information
   has become available.
