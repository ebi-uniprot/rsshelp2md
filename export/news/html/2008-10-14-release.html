   UniProt Consortium
  </a>
  ,
      was established 10 years ago, on 30th March 1998, thanks to the enthusiasm and dedication of
      a small number of outstanding Swiss scientists. In these past 10 years, the SIB has evolved
      into a federation of 25 research and service
  <a href="http://www.isb-sib.ch/groups/intro.htm">
   groups
  </a>
  based in 5 locations in Switzerland: Basel, Berne, Geneva, Lausanne and Zurich. It comprises a
      total of close to 300 members affiliated to the best universities and institutes of Switzerland.
 </p>

  The SIB has 3 main missions: research, services and training. It develops and maintains
      databases, such as
