  Over 20,000 fungal proteins manually annotated in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
 </h3>
 <p>
  Almost exactly one year after the integration of the complete proteome of
  <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/newt/display?search=4932">
   <em>
    Saccharomyces
       cerevisiae
   </em>
  </a>
  into UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (see
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/news/2007/01/09/release">
   news
  </a>
  ),
      we have increased the number of manually annotated fungal entries to more than
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy:fungi+AND+reviewed:yes">
   20 000
  </a>
  .

  The fungal kingdom includes very diverse organisms, from unicellular to
      multicellular, from microscopic to macroscopic. Fungi have essential roles in
      many ecological processes. They are required for nutrient cycling within
      ecosystems, since they recycle dead organic matter into useful nutrients. Many
      plants would not survive without symbiotic fungi called mycorrhizae, which live
      in their roots and supply essential nutrients. They are also economically
      important as they provide numerous drugs (such as penicillin), food (such as
      mushrooms) and are used for their ability to ferment different sugars to
      produce bread, wine, beer and even soy sauce.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fungi are also responsible for a great number of severe plant and animal
      diseases. Fungal infections, also called mycotic infections, may affect the
      skin or the internal organs of the body. Severe mycotic infections, such as
      histoplasmosis and candidiasis, are potentially life-threatening. Fungal
      diseases are very difficult to treat since fungi are eukaryotic organisms that
      share many properties with animal or human cells. Plant diseases caused by
      fungi include rusts and smuts, as well as leaf, root, and stem rot. They can
      cause severe damage to crop production.
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, many fungi are important model organisms for studying the genetics and
      molecular biology of eukaryotes.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is therefore not surprising that many fungi were targeted for the
      complete genome sequencing. No less that 32 complete fungal genomes
      have been submitted to public sequence databases to date. Using the
  <em>
   S.
       cerevisiae
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Schizosaccharomyces pombe
  </em>
  fully annotated proteomes
      as templates, we are progressively annotating orthologous proteins in these
      newcomers, in order to provide our users with a high-quality fungal protein
      dataset that will better reflect the diversity of this kingdom.

  Cross-references have been added to the public repository of 2D-gel data
  <a href="http://world-2dpage.expasy.org/">
   World-2DPAGE
  </a>
  . All 2D gel data to be
     published in the journal Proteomics needs to be available on the web. The
     World-2DPAGE repository hosts the data for resources who cannot build and
     maintain a web interface. There are currently two data sources submitted to
     World-2DPAGE, which are numbered consecutively:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   0001: CGL14067-2DPAGE, Corynebacterium glutamicum entries

 <p>
  In cross-references to Cornea-2DPAGE, DOSAC-COBS-2DPAGE, HSC-2DPAGE,
REPRODUCTION-2DPAGE and SWISS-2DPAGE, the optional information field 1 used to be the
species origin.
The species information has become obsolete/redundant since UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot no
longer contains entries describing the same protein from different species (see
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/news/2005/12/20/release">
   Release 6.7
  </a>
  ).
We have therefore replaced the species information by "-".

     classification of human and mouse protein kinases into subfamilies or subgroups,
     as developed by Gerard Manning. The classification from Diego Miranda-Saavedra
     has also been taken into account.

 <p>
  This document contains all UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot human and mouse protein kinase
     entries, subdivided into 10 subfamilies or subgroups. Each
     gene name is followed by the corresponding human and/or mouse
     UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry name (and accession number).
