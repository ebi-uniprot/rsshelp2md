  One thousand legs and a few toxins
 </h3>
 <p>
  Have you ever faced an elongated and dorso-ventrally flattened arthropod? If yes,
      it could have been a scolopendra or one of its cousins of the "numberless feet" family,
      i.e. the Myriapoda subphylum. If you were lucky enough not to be stung, you avoided intense local or irradiating pain, redness, edema, local hyperthermia,
      superficial necrosis, or even systemic symptoms such as nausea, emesis, sudoresis, anxiety and depression.
 </p>
 <p>
  What is the cause of these symptoms? Information about scolopendra venom composition is very limited, probably due to the lack of
      severe systemic symptoms and fatalities in adults. However, in 2007, a group of researchers
      studied the neglected group of scolopenders (see
  <a href="http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17320133">
   Rates et al., 2007
  </a>
  ),
      using a structure-to-function proteomic approach in order to better understand the complexity
      of the venoms of two Brazilian scolopendra species:
      Scolopendra viridicornis nigra and

  have been characterized and their N-termini
      sequenced. As of this release, they are all available in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.
