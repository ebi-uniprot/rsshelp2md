  The most frequently updated entry
 </h3>
 <p>
  The most obvious way to quantify the work done by
    UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot is to count the increase in new entries.
    However, the integration of new entries is only part of the
    annotation work. Providing the scientific community with high
    quality data also - and maybe mostly - involves time-consuming
    updates of older entries. Thanks to the introduction of sequence
    and annotation version numbers and to the creation of the
  <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/unisave/">
   UniProtKB
    Sequence/Annotation Version Database
  </a>
  , it is now possible to know
    when and how a UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry has been updated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sequences shown at the bottom of each entry are relatively stable.
    In 83% of entries, the sequence has not been updated since its
    integration in the knowledgebase, in 15% of the entries, it has
    been updated once. So far, the maximal number of sequence updates
    is 6 times and this is observed only in 8 entries. By contrast,
    the annotation has to be constantly reviewed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently the average UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry has been
    updated more than 50 times. The most frequently updated entry is
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P00740">
   human coagulation factor IX
  </a>
  which
    has been reviewed 103 times while its sequence has been updated
    only once. The human coagulation factor IX entry was created in
    the first UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot release in July 1986. Since then,
    over 50 references have been added, mostly dealing with polymorphisms
    and disease-causing mutations. This is also reflected at the
    level of the feature table, where the number of described
    variants had risen from 1 to 145, most of them associated with
    hemophilia. While the presence of gamma-carboxyglutamate was
    already well-established 20 years ago and the sites of
    N-glycosylation suspected, other post-translational modifications,
    such as sites of O-glycosylation, phosphorylation and sulfation
    were described, and thus annotated, later. Information on secondary
    structure was added to the entry in 1994, as well as the first
    link to the 3D structure submitted to PDB. Today 7 cross-references
    to PDB are provided.
 </p>
 <p>
  Science is going forward and we, at Swiss-Prot, are doing our
    best to keep pace. Nevertheless, we need the user community to
    help us in this task. All our entries are equipped with a "Submit
    update" button and we greatly encourage you to use it every time
    your favourite protein is not up-to-date in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot,
    or if it is not yet integrated.
