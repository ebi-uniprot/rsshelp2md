                         1. Introduction


TrEMBL is a computer-annotated protein sequence database supplementing the
SWISS-PROT Protein Knowledgebase. TrEMBL contains the translations of
all coding sequences (CDS) present in the EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ Nucleotide
Sequence Databases and also protein sequences extracted from the literature
or submitted to SWISS-PROT, which are not yet integrated into SWISS-PROT.
TrEMBL can be considered as a preliminary section of SWISS-PROT. For all
TrEMBL entries which should finally be upgraded to the standard SWISS-PROT
quality, SWISS-PROT accession numbers have been assigned.

                        2. Why a supplement to SWISS-PROT?

The ongoing gene sequencing and mapping projects have dramatically
increased the number of protein sequences to be incorporated into SWISS-PROT.
We do not want to dilute the quality standards of SWISS-PROT by incorporating
sequences without proper sequence analysis and annotation, but we do want to
make the sequences available as quickly as possible. TrEMBL achieves this
second goal, and is a major step in the process of speeding up subsequent
upgrading of annotation to the standard SWISS-PROT quality.
To address the problem of redundancy, the translations of all coding
sequences (CDS) in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database already included
in SWISS-PROT have been removed from TrEMBL.


                             3. The Release

This TrEMBL release was created from the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database
release 70 and updates until 07.05.02 and contains 751'148 entries
and 218'504'701 amino acids. To minimize redundancy, the translations of all
coding sequences (CDS) in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database already
included in SWISS-PROT release 40 and updates until 21.06.02 have been
removed from TrEMBL release 21.

TrEMBL is split in two main sections: SP-TrEMBL and REM-TrEMBL:
SP-TrEMBL (SWISS-PROT TrEMBL) contains the entries (671'580) which should be
eventually incorporated into SWISS-PROT. SWISS-PROT accession numbers have
been assigned for all SP-TrEMBL entries.

SP-TrEMBL is organized in subsections:

arc.dat (Archaea):                        1644 entries
arp.dat (Complete Archaeal proteomes):   29757 entries
fun.dat (Fungi):                         14606 entries
hum.dat (Human):                         29766 entries
inv.dat (Invertebrates):                 68301 entries
mam.dat (Other Mammals):                 10511 entries
mhc.dat (MHC proteins):                   8069 entries
org.dat (Organelles):                    58906 entries
phg.dat (Bacteriophages):                 5676 entries
pln.dat (Plants):                        67339 entries
pro.dat (Prokaryotes):                   66680 entries
prp.dat (Complete Prokaryotic Proteomes):123685 entries
rod.dat (Rodents):                       27467 entries
unc.dat (Unclassified):                    143 entries
vrl.dat (Viruses):                       71522 entries
vrt.dat (Other Vertebrates):             12279 entries
vrv.dat (Retroviruses):                  75229 entries

56'042 new entries have been integrated in SP-TrEMBL. The sequences of
810 SP-TrEMBL entries have been updated and the annotation has been
updated in 189'983 entries.

In the document deleteac.txt, you will find a list of all accession numbers
which were previously present in TrEMBL, but which have now been deleted from
the database.

REM-TrEMBL (REMaining TrEMBL) contains the entries (79'568) that we do
not want to include in SWISS-PROT. REM-TrEMBL entries have no accession
numbers. This section is organized in six subsections:

   1) Immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors (Immuno.dat)
      Most REM-TrEMBL entries are  immunoglobulins and  T-cell receptors. We
      stopped entering immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors into SWISS-PROT,
      because we only want to keep  the  germ line gene derived translations
      of these proteins in SWISS-PROT and not all known somatic recombinated
      variations of  these proteins.  We would like to  create a specialized
      database  dealing  with  these  sequences  as a further  supplement to
      SWISS-PROT  and  keep  only a  representative  cross-section of  these
      proteins in SWISS-PROT.

   2) Synthetic sequences (Synth.dat)
      Another category of data, which will not be included in SWISS-PROT are
      synthetic sequences.  Again, we do not want to  leave these entries in
      TrEMBL. Ideally one should build a specialized database for artificial
      sequences as a further supplement to SWISS-PROT.

   3) Patent application sequences (Patent.dat)
      A third  subsection consists of  coding sequences captured from patent
      applications.  A thorough  survey of  these  entries  have shown  that
      apart from a rather small minority  (which in  most cases have already
      been integrated in SWISS-PROT), most of these sequences contain either
      erroneous data or concern artificially generated sequences outside the
      scope of SWISS-PROT.

   4) Small fragments (Smalls.dat)
      Another  subsection  consists of fragments  with less than eight amino
      acids.

   5) CDS not coding for real proteins (Pseudo.dat)
      This subsection consists of CDS translations where we have strong
      evidence to believe that these CDS are not coding for real proteins.

   6) Truncated proteins (Truncated.dat)
      The last subsection consists of truncated proteins which result from
      events like mutations introducing a stop codon leading to the truncation
      of the protein product.

                4. Format Differences Between SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL

The format and conventions used by TrEMBL follow as closely as possible
that of SWISS-PROT. Hence, it is not necessary to produce an additional
user manual and extensive release notes for TrEMBL. The information given
in the SWISS-PROT release notes and user manual are in general valid for
TrEMBL. The differences are mentioned below.

The general structure of an entry is identical in SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL.
The data class used in TrEMBL (in the ID line) is always 'PRELIMINARY',
whereas in SWISS-PROT it is always 'STANDARD'.

Differences in line types present in SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL:

The ID line (IDentification):

The entry name used in SP-TrEMBL is the same as the Accession Number of the
entry. The entry name used in REM-TrEMBL is the stable part of the protein_id
tagged to the corresponding CDS in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database.
'protein_id' stands for the "Protein Identification" number. It is a number
that you will find in the feature table of the EMBL nucleotide sequence
entries in a qualifier called "/protein_id" which is tagged to every CDS.

Example:

FT   CDS             339..1514
FT                   /codon_start=1
FT                   /db_xref="PID:g1256015"
FT                   /product="dystrobrevin-epsilon"
FT                   /protein_id="AAC50431.1"

The protein_id is defined as follows in the The DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank Feature Table
Definition documentation
Qualifier          /protein_id
Definition         Protein Identifier, issued by International collaborators.
                   This qualifier consists of a stable ID portion (3+5 format
                   with 3 position letters and 5 numbers) plus a version
                   number after the decimal point.

Value format
Example            /protein_id="AAA12345.1"
Comment            When the protein sequence encoded by the CDS changes, only
                   the version number of the /protein_id value is incremented.
                   The stable part of the /protein_id remains unchanged and
                   as a result will permanently be associated with a given
                   protein. This qualifier is valid only on CDS features
                   which translate into a valid protein.


The DT line (DaTe)

The format of the DT lines that serve to indicate when an entry was
created and updated are identical to that defined in SWISS-PROT; but the
DT lines in TrEMBL refer to the TrEMBL release. The difference is
shown in the example below.

    DT lines in a SWISS-PROT entry:

    DT   01-JAN-1988 (Rel. 06, Created)
    DT   01-JUL-1989 (Rel. 11, Last sequence update)
    DT   01-AUG-1992 (Rel. 23, Last annotation update)

    DT lines in a TrEMBL entry:

    DT   01-NOV-1996 (TrEMBLrel. 01, Created)
    DT   01-NOV-1996 (TrEMBLrel. 01, Last sequence update)
    DT   01-FEB-1997 (TrEMBLrel. 02, Last annotation update)

                5. Weekly updates of TrEMBL and non-redundant data sets

Weekly cumulative updates of TrEMBL are available by anonymous FTP and
from the EBI SRS server.

We also produce every week a complete non-redundant protein sequence
collection by providing three compressed files (these are in the directory
/pub/databases/sp_tr_nrdb on the EBI FTP server and in databases/sp_tr_nrdb
on the ExPASy server): sprot.dat.gz, trembl.dat.gz and trembl_new.dat.gz.
This set of non-redundant files is especially important for two types of
users:
(i) Managers of similarity search services. They can now provide what is
currently the most comprehensive and non-redundant data set of protein
sequences.
(ii) Anybody wanting to update their full copy of SWISS-PROT + TrEMBL to
their own schedule without having to wait for full releases of SWISS-PROT
or of TrEMBL.

We also recently introduced Varsplic Expand which is a program to generate
"expanded" sequences from SWISS-PROT records i.e. sequences including the
variants specified by the varsplic, variant and conflict annotations. New
records are produced in either pseudo-SWISS-PROT or FASTA format for each
specified variant. More information and the data is available at
ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/sp_tr_nrdb/

                6. Access/Data Distribution

FTP server:     ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/trembl
SRS server:     http://srs.ebi.ac.uk/

TrEMBL is also available on the SWISS-PROT CD-ROM.
SWISS-PROT + TrEMBL is searchable on the following servers at the EBI:

FASTA3  (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/fasta33/)
BLAST2  (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/blast2/)
Bic_sw  (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/bic_sw/)

For each TrEMBL release, a synchronized version of the concurrent SWISS-PROT
release is distributed at ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/trembl/swissprot/

 7. Planned changes


7.1 Evidence tags:

    We are continuing with the introduction of evidence tags to SWISS-PROT and
    TrEMBL entries. The aim of this is to allow users to see where data items
    came from and to enable SWISS-PROT staff to automatically update data if
    the underlying evidence changes. This is ongoing internally and we hope
    to provide a public version in 2002. For more information,
    please see
    ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/trembl/evidenceDocumentation.html
    We would welcome any feedback from the user community.

7.2 Conversion of TrEMBL to mixed case:

    Most of the DE (DEscription), GN (Gene Name), RC (Reference Comment)
    and CC (Comment) lines have been converted to mixed case internally. The
    conversion is ongoing and will be made public as the conversion of each
    line type reaches a satisfactory stage. A mixed case version of the DE
    line has been made public in this release.

7.3 Version of SWISS-PROT/TrEMBL in XML format:

    A distribution version of SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL in XML format is
    being developed. The first draft of the new XML format, SP-ML
    (SWISS-PROT Markup Language) can be found at
    http://www.ebi.ac.uk/swissprot/SP-ML.
    We would welcome any feedback from the user community.
