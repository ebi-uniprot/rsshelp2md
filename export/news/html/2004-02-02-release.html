  SPIN - the new web tool for sequence submission to Swiss-Prot
 </h3>
 <p>
  A new web-based tool,
  <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/swissprot/Submissions/spin/">
   SPIN
  </a>
  ,
      is available for submitting directly sequenced protein sequences and their biological annotations
      to the Swiss-Prot Protein Knowledgebase. SPIN guides you through a sequence of WWW forms allowing
       interactive submission. The information required to create a database entry will be collected during this process.
 </p>
 <p>
  Annotation updates for existing Swiss-Prot entries are highly appreciated and should
      be submitted via the "Submit Update" button at the top of any entry
      [
  <a>
   example

  ]. User update requests are treated with a high priority by our annotators.
