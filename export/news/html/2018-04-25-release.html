 Collagen is the major protein that stitches together animal tissues, and is the most abundant protein in mammals, making up to 25-35% of our body weight. It comprises three individual protein molecules which coil together to form tropocollagen fibers which in turn make microfibrils. Collagen is extremely stable and extremely ancient; collagen fragments have been sequenced from 80 million year old dinosaurs, such as

  <em>

  </em>
  and
  <em>
   Tyrannosaurus rex
  </em>
 </a>
 , and is found in all extant metazoans. The breakdown of collagen is essential to permit tissue growth, and all animals have the ability to metabolize collagen in a very controlled way

 . Infectious bacteria, such as gas gangrene-causing

 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3002446">
  both endopeptidase and tripeptidylcarboxypeptidase activities
 </a>
 . This rampant activity causes massive tissue disruption, favoring bacterial colonization and virulence, and is obviously severely problematic in a clinical setting.

<p>
 Despite their different approaches to collagen degradation (cautious versus gung-ho), mammalian and clostridial collagenases have similar enzymatic mechanisms and many inhibitors work on both types of collagenases, making them unsuitable for antibacterial therapy. Recent work by
 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28820255">
  Sch√∂nauer et al.
 </a>
 has found promising new molecules that inhibit only bacterial and not mammalian collagenases, pointing to a possible way to block bacterial collagenase action in a wound setting for example. By not attacking the bacteria directly, these inhibitors should provide novel, non-selective ways to treat some of the damage inflicted by these bacteria, while minimizing potential resistance. While these inhibitors are undoubtedly very useful, there are also many applications in which potentially undesirable bacterial collagenase activities are actively exploited. The
