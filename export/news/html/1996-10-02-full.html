First release of TREMBL, a protein sequence database supplementing
the SWISS-PROT Protein Sequence Data Bank


INTRODUCTION
============

TREMBL is a protein sequence database supplementing the SWISS-PROT Protein
Sequence Data Bank. TREMBL contains the translations of all coding
sequences (CDS) present in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database not yet
integrated in SWISS-PROT. TREMBL can be considered as a preliminary
section of SWISS-PROT. For all TREMBL entries which should finally be
upgraded to the standard SWISS-PROT quality, SWISS-PROT accession numbers
have been assigned.


FIRST RELEASE OF TREMBL
=======================

This TREMBL release is created from the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database
release 48 and contains 104'962 sequence entries, comprising 28'063'108
amino acids. TREMBL release 1 will be distributed with SWISS-PROT release 34.


TREMBL is split in two main sections; SP-TREMBL and REM-TREMBL:

SP-TREMBL (SWISS-PROT TREMBL) contains the entries (86'040) which should be
incorporated into SWISS-PROT. SWISS-PROT accession numbers have been assigned
for all SP-TREMBL entries.

SP-TREMBL is organized in subsections:

fun.dat (Fungi):                3367 entries
hum.dat (Human):                4322 entries
inv.dat (Invertebrates):       11920 entries
mam.dat (Other Mammals):        1768 entries
mhc.dat (MHC proteins):         2050 entries
org.dat (Organelles):           6285 entries
phg.dat (Bacteriophages):        866 entries
pln.dat (Plants):               5524 entries
pro.dat (Prokaryotes):         17222 entries
rod.dat (Rodents):              4573 entries
vrl.dat (Viruses):             26042 entries
vrt.dat (Other Vertebrates):    2101 entries


REM-TREMBL (REMaining TREMBL) contains the entries (19'255) that we do
not want to include in SWISS-PROT.
