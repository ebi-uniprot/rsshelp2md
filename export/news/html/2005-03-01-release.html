  More than 10'000 additional sequences encoded on splice variants in Swiss-Prot
 </h3>
 Swiss-Prot is a
 <strong>
  non-redundant
 </strong>
 protein knowledgebase where the protein
     sequences from the same organism originating from the same gene are merged into
     one entry. When alternative products are produced by alternative
     splicing, the number of isoforms and their properties are indicated
     in the comment lines under the
 <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/manual/alternative_products">
  "Alternative products"
 </a>
 topic,
     and the
 <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-0025">
  "Alternative splicing"
 </a>
 keyword is added to the entry. The sequences of the alternative forms,
      if known, are described in the
 <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/docs/userman.htm#FT_line">
  feature table
 </a>
 under
      the key name "VARSPLIC". E.g. PRKN2_HUMAN (
 <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/O60260">
  O60260
 </a>
 ).
 <p>
  More frequently than not, it is the longest isoform that is shown in a Swiss-Prot entry.
       The additional isoforms can be reconstructed from the annotation.
       We assign an unique identifier for each isoform (IsoId), and unique feature
       identifiers (FTId) to each "VARSPLIC" feature described in the feature table.
       Each IsoId comes with a list of FTIds which serve as "instructions" to be applied
       in order to reconstruct the isoform's sequence.

  The number of these additional Swiss-Prot recreated splice variants has recently
         reached the 10'000 mark.
 </p>
 <p>
  More than a half are
  <a href="http://www.expasy.org/sprot/hpi/hpi_stat.html">
   human isoforms
  </a>
  . More than
         80% are from mammals.

            and TrEMBL

           in addition to all Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL entries, all other annotated splice isoforms.
