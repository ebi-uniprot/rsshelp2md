  More than  500'000 comment blocks in Swiss-Prot
 </h3>
 <p>
  One of the important aspects of the annotation process
     is to provide, for each protein, a description of a number of
     meaningful biological elements such as the function or role of a protein, its subcellular
     location, its membership in a specific family, etc.
     All of this information is stored in the
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/docs/userman.htm#CC_line">
   comments field (CC)
  </a>
  .
     Comments are organized by topics, 24 types of which are currently
     defined. A specific comment can consist of several sentences or other textual elements,
     which are grouped into what we term a comment block.
 </p>
 The total number of comment blocks has now reached the 500'000 mark, which
      corresponds to an average of 3.5 blocks per Swiss-Prot entry.
