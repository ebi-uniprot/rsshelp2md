  Major update of C.elegans entries
 </h3>
 <p>
  We have recently finished a major update of Caenorhabditis elegans entries
     in Swiss-Prot. The following tasks were carried out:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Update and "homogeneization" of all references to the genome project and sequence revisions;
  </li>
  <li>
   Addition of cross-references to WormBase;
  </li>
  <li>
   Re-annotation of many existing entries using literature references;
  </li>
  <li>
   Manual annotation of about one hundred new entries.
  </li>
 </ul>
