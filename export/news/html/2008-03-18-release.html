  A small but deadly pathogen: Hepatitis B virus
 </h3>
 <p>
  The
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/10407">
   Hepatitis B virus
  </a>
  (
  <a href="http://viralzone.expasy.org/viralzone/all_by_species/9.html">
   HBV
  </a>
  ) causes transient and chronic infections of the liver and
      constitutes a major cause of human disease. It is estimated that more than 5% of the
      global population carries the virus, and deaths from liver cancer caused by HBV
      probably exceed one million per year (see
  <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs204/en/">
   WHO factsheet
  </a>
  ). An effective vaccine
      has been available for nearly 20 years, but its high cost still hampers
      disease control in the developing world.
 </p>
 <p>
  This killer virus has a surprisingly small genome, about 3.2 kb, which nevertheless encodes
      for 5 proteins through overlapping open reading frames. It
      replicates by reverse-transcribing genomic RNA to partial dsDNA through a
      unique mechanism, and thus belongs to a particular family: the hepadnaviridae.
 </p>
 <p>
  The virus specifically infects hepatocytes, and most symptoms in an acute
      infection result from the killing of infected cells by the host immune system. In
      a few cases, the virus manages to down-regulate the host immunity and establishes a
      chronic infection. A viral protein secreted in blood is suspected to be
      involved in chronicity: the
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P0C625">
   HbeAg
  </a>
  protein may specifically deplete T-helper lymphocytes, thereby suppressing the ability
      to mount a strong cytotoxic response against infected hepatocytes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our current knowledge of the virus is rather poor due to the lack of cell
      culture systems allowing
  <em>
   in vitro
  </em>
  viral propagation. Much of what we know is
      derived from the study of other closely related hepadnaviridae, such as the
      woodchuck hepatitis virus (
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy:10430+AND+reviewed:yes">
   WHV
  </a>
  ) and the ground
      squirrel hepatitis virus (
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=_gshv+AND+reviewed:yes">
   GSHV
  </a>
  ).

 <p>
  In the current UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot release, all
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=organism:hepatitis%2Bb+AND+reviewed:yes">
   hepatitis B virus
      entries
  </a>
  have been updated, and 51 strains representative of the 8 genotypes
      infecting humans have been annotated. Animal hepatitis B viruses
      entries have also been revisited, notably WHV and GSHV.

  Cross-references to ProMEX
 </h3>
 <p>
  Cross-references have been added to the
  <a href="http://promex.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/">
   Protein Mass spectra EXtraction database
  </a>
  . ProMEX is a mass spectral library
      consisting of tryptic peptide product ion spectra generated by liquid chromatography
      coupled to ion trap mass spectrometry (LC-ITMS) and was developed using samples derived
      from Arabidopsis thaliana and Medicago truncatula. The database serves as a reference
      and can be used for protein identification in uncharacterized samples. Protein
      identification by ProMEX is linked to other molecular levels of biological
      organization such as metabolite, pathway and transcript data. The database is further
      connected to annotation and classification services.
