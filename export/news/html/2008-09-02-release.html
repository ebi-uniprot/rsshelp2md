  First draft of the complete human proteome available in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
 </h3>
 <p>
  The UniProt consortium is pleased to announce that a manually annotated representation
      of all the currently known human protein-coding genes is available in this release of
      UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. This represents
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy%3A9606+AND+reviewed%3Ayes">
   20,325 entries
  </a>
  .
      More than a

   third of these
  </a>
  contain additional sequences representing isoforms generated by
      alternative splicing, alternative promoter usage and/or alternative translation
      initiation, resulting in close to 34,000 human protein sequences. Approximately
      46,000 single amino acid polymorphisms (SAPs), mostly disease-linked,
      are also described, as well as 60,000 post-translational modifications (PTMs)
      (for additional statistics, click

  </a>
  ).
 </p>
 <p>
  It is not the first time that UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot has provided a fully annotated
      proteome for a model organism (for example
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy:83333+AND+keyword:181">
   <em>
    E.coli
   </em>
  </a>

   <em>
    S.cerevisiae
   </em>
  </a>
  ) and
      there are many more planned in the near and more distant future
      (

  , etc).
      But we do not expect that there will ever be anything as important as this
      proteome. For the first time, we can present to the life sciences community a
      clean set of what we believe to be a full (although still imperfect!)
      representation of human proteins. It is the ultimate goal of the life sciences
      to fully understand
  <em>
   Homo sapiens
  </em>
  at the molecular level and we hope this set
      will significantly contribute to this extraordinary adventure.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are still many challenging tasks in front of us. We will create entries
      for newly discovered human proteins, review and update the existing set,
      increase the number of splice variants, explore the full range of PTMs and
      continue to build a comprehensive view of protein variation in the human
      population. The characterization at the molecular level will need to be placed
      in its physiological context: subcellular location, tissue expression,
      protein/protein interaction, etc. And last but not the least, we all want to
      understand the role of all these actors of our life processes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The way is paved, but the road will be long before we fully understand life at a
      molecular level.
