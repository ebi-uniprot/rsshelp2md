                         1. INTRODUCTION

   1.1  Evolution

   Release 12.0  of SWISS-PROT  contains 12305 sequence entries, comprising
   3'797'482 amino  acids abstracted from 12147 references. This represents
   an increase of 16% over release 11.0. The recent growth of the data bank
   is summarized below:

   1.2  Source of data

   Release 12.0  has been  updated using protein sequence data from release
   21.0 of  the PIR (Protein Identification Resource) protein data bank, as
   well as translation of nucleotide sequence data from release 20.0 of the
   EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Data Library.

   As an  indication to  the source  of the sequence data in the SWISS-PROT
   data bank  we list  here the  statistics  concerning  the  DR  (Databank
   Reference) pointer lines:

   Entries with pointer(s) to only PIR entri(es):           3125
   Entries with pointer(s) to only EMBL entri(es):          4873
   Entries with pointer(s) to both EMBL and PIR entri(es):  3575
   Entries with no pointers lines (entered in house):        732



      2. DESCRIPTION OF THE CHANGES MADE TO SWISS-PROT SINCE RELEASE 11

   2.1  Sequences and annotations

   Some 1466  new sequences  have been  added since  the last  release, the
   sequence  data  of  173  existing  entries  has  been  updated  and  the
   annotations of  2400 entries  have been  revised. In  particular we have
   used reviews  articles to update the annotations of the following groups
   or families of proteins:

      Acyl carrier proteins
      Aminoacyl-transfer RNA synthetases
      Biotin-requiring enzymes
      Chloroplast photosystems I and II proteins
      Creatine kinases
      Crp bacterial activator proteins
      Enolases
      Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenases
      Glutaredoxins
      GTP-binding elongation factors
      Heat shock hsp90 proteins
      Insulin family proteins
      Insulin-like growth factor binding proteins
      Insect-type alcohol dehydrogenases / ribitol dehydrogenase family
      Integrins
      Iron-containing alcohol dehydrogenases
      LysR bacterial activator proteins
      Malate dehydrogenase
      Mammalian defensins
      Mitochondrial energy transfer proteins
      Myc-type proteins
      Phosphoglucose isomerases
      Phosphoglycerate kinases
      Serine/threonine specific protein phosphatases
      Sugar transporters
      Uracil-DNA glycosylases
      Vertebrate galactoside-binding lectins
      Zinc-containing alcohol dehydrogenases


   2.2  New line-type

   This release  introduce an  new type  of data  line, the OG line. The OG
   (OrGanelle) lines  indicate if  the gene coding for a protein originates
   from the mitochondria, the chloroplast, or a plasmid. The format for the
   OG line is:

   OG   CHLOROPLAST.
   OG   MITOCHONDRION.
   OG   PLASMID name.

   Where 'name' is the name of the plasmid.

   Previously this  information was  stored in the OS line, as shown in the
   example below.

   OS   WHEAT (TRITICUM AESTIVUM) CHLOROPLAST.

   The above example will now be stored as:

   OS   WHEAT (TRITICUM AESTIVUM).
   OG   CHLOROPLAST.


   2.3  New topic for the comments (CC) line type

   As of release 12 we have added a new 'topic' for the comments (CC) line-
   type: CAUTION,  which is  used to  warn  about  possible  errors  and/or
   grounds for confusion. Example of its usage:

     CC   -!- CAUTION: ALSO SEE VERSION 2 OF THIS PROTEIN THAT DIFFERS DUE
     CC       TO A FRAMESHIFT.


   2.4  Documentation changes

   -  ACINDEX.TXT is  a new  document file  which is  an index  of all  the
      accession numbers  which appear  in SWISS-PROT  and the  name of  the
      entries in which they occur.
   -  PDBTOSP.TXT is  a new  document file  which is  an index  of all  the
      Brookhaven PDB entries referenced in SWISS-PROT.
   -  The JOURLIST.TXT document now indicates the abbreviation and the full
      names of all journals cited in SWISS-PROT.


                             3. THE NEXT RELEASE

   SWISS-PROT release 13.0 will be available in January 1990.

   Starting with  release 13 SWISS-PROT will be distributed with PROSITE, a
   data bank  of sites  and patterns  in proteins.  Both data banks will be
   fully cross-referenced.



                            4. WE NEED YOUR HELP !

   We welcome  any feedback  from our users. We especially would appreciate
   that you notify us if you find that sequences belonging to your field of
   expertise are  missing from  the data  bank. We  also would  like to  be
   notified about annotations to be updated, as for example if the function
   of a protein has been clarified or if new post-translational information
   has become available.
