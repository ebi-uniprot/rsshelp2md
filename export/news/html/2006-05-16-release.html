 <p>
  In order to provide the scientific community with a summary of
    the current knowledge on animal protein toxins, the Swiss-Prot group
    initiated the
  <a href="http://www.expasy.org/sprot/tox-prot/">
   Tox-Prot
    annotation project
  </a>
  . The aim of this program is the annotation
    of all toxin proteins produced by venomous animals, such as snakes,
    scorpions, spiders, jellyfish, insects, cone snails, sea anemones,
    lizards, some fish, and platypus.
 </p>
 <p>
  Toxins are small (usually less than 100 amino acids) and
    extremely stable. They undergo numerous post-translational
    modifications and they have very specific targets. The 3D-structure
    of about 15% of the known toxins has been unravelled, which
    provides clues to the understanding of their specificity. Many
    toxins, such as those synthetized by cone snails (conotoxins),
    can be used as drugs and some are presently tested in clinical
    trials.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the level of annotation and ultimately for the sequence
    retrieval by our users, the lack of a systematic nomenclature
    represents a real problem. This issue is currently being addressed
    by the scientific community and an official nomenclature has been
    developed for potassium channel scorpion toxins:
  <a href="http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10542442">
   Tytgat et al. (1999)
  </a>
  and
  <a href="http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15208019">
   Rodriguez de la Vega and Possani (2004)
  </a>
  .
    With the help of Dr. Ricardo C. Rodriguez de la Vega and Prof.
    Lourival D. Possani, we have created a
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/docs/scorpktx.txt">
   document
  </a>
  which provides links between the official nomenclature and the
    associated UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, we would like to draw your attention on the fact that
    many toxin sequences are not submitted to any databases and have
    to be manually retrieved by Swiss-Prot annotators. This step slows
    down the annotation process itself and may be error-prone. We thus
    would like to encourage researchers to share their data
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/submissions">
   by submitting it
  </a>
  to public databases
    such as EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ for nucleic acid sequences,
    and UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot for protein sequences. Experimental data
    can also be directly submitted by e-mail. For any comments or
    suggestions concerning the Tox-Prot annotation project, don't
    hesitate to

  Nomenclature of scorpion potassium channel toxins
 </h3>
 <p>
  The document
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/docs/scorpktx.txt">
   scorpktx.txt
  </a>
  lists the potassium-channel-specific scorpion toxins known to date,
    according to the nomenclature system first described in 1999 by
  <a href="http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10542442">
   Tytgat et al.
  </a>
  and extended in
  <a href="http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15208019">
   de la Vega et al.
  </a>
  .
    This document contains, for each individual UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
    scorpion potassium channel toxin, the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
    accession number, the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry name, the
    systematic name, together with other scorpion potassium channel
    toxin names.
