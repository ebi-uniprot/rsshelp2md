  10,000 different citations for JBC in Swiss-Prot
 </h3>
 <p>
  The
  <a>
   Journal of Biological Chemistry
  </a>
  (generally
        known as JBC) has always been a gold mine for publications directly relevant
        to the scope of Swiss-Prot. Starting with the first release in 1986 and up to
        now it has always been the most cited journal in Swiss-Prot. We are now
        citing about 10,000 different JBC papers in Swiss-Prot. This is almost twice the
        value for the next most cited journal, PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy
         of Sciences of the U.S.A.).
 </p>
 <p>
  It is also noteworthy that JBC was the first major life science journal to
         be available as full text on the WWW. It is therefore a good opportunity to
         thank the JBC editorial board and its staff for the great service they are
         providing to the Life Sciences community.

 <h3>
  New documentation file
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/docs/strains">
   strains.txt
  </a>
 </h3>
 <p>
  The strain information is usually given in the RC line of the reference
block, but can also be indicated in the Organism (OS) line of a database entry.
Strains are controlled vocabulary and we created a list of the strains and
their synonyms. This information is now made available in the documentation
file strains.txt, together with the mnemonic species identification code
representing the biological source of the protein in the knowledgebase.
 </p>
 <h3>
  New format of the documentation file
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/docs/keywlist">
   keywlist.txt
  </a>
 </h3>
 <p>
  Keywords are controlled vocabulary and the annotation follows strict rules. As biological terms
can have several meanings, we added to the list of keywords the definition of their usage
in the knowledgebase and further information such as synonyms or relevant GO terms.
 </p>
 <p>
  Please note that the file header changed and the format for each keyword entry looks as follows:
 </p>
 <pre>
Line code  Content                         Occurrence in an entry

ID         Identifier (keyword)            Once; starts an entry
AC         Accession (KW-xxxx)             Once
DE         Definition                      Once or more
SY         Synonyms                        Optional; Once or more
GO         Gene ontology (GO) mapping      Optional; Once or more
HI         Hierarchy                       Optional; Once or more
WW         Interesting WWW site            Optional; Once or more

  Example of a keyword definition entry:
 </p>
 <pre>
ID   Acetoin catabolism.
AC   KW-0006
DE   Protein involved in the degradation of acetoin (3-hydroxy-2-butanone).
DE   Acetoin is a component of the butanediol cycle (butanediol
DE   fermentation) in microorganisms.
SY   Acetoin degradation.
GO   GO:0045150; acetoin catabolism
CA   Biological process; Pathway.

 <h3>
  Change in the name of the files containing deleted AC numbers
 </h3>
 <p>
  As UniProt knowledgebase documentation now comprises both Swiss-Prot and
TrEMBL, we changed the name of the files "deleteac.txt" containing deleted AC numbers
to
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   "delac_sp.txt" (for deleted Swiss-Prot ACs)
  </li>
  <li>
   "delac_tr.txt" (for deleted TrEMBL ACs).
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h3>
  Discontinuation of the embltosp.txt index file
 </h3>
 <p>
  The embltosp.txt file, which contained an index of EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database entries referenced in
Swiss-Prot, is no longer available.
