 <h3>
  Massive number of changes to entry names
 </h3>
 <p>
  We recently allowed entry names
     to consist of up to 11 characters instead of 10. An entry name
     consists of two parts, a prefix which is a mnemonic code representing
     the protein name and a suffix which is a mnemonic species
     identification code. Example: RECA_BACSU is the entry name for the
     recA protein of
  <em>
   Bacillus subtilis
  </em>
  . The increase from 10 to 11
     characters allows the protein name mnemonic to increase from 4 to 5
     characters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks to this change, we are now able to assign more meaningful
      entry names to a significant number of entries. In the past month we
      have gone through almost all of the Swiss-Prot entries and have
      checked to see if they could benefit from an entry name update. As a
      consequence of this process we updated more than 35'000 entry names
      (about 20% of all the entries in Swiss-Prot). In about 33'000 cases
      we created ID prefixes consisting of 5 characters and in the rest of
      the cases we changed existing prefixes of 3 to 4 characters to more
      meaningful and consistent prefixes of the same length.
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to this massive changes in entry names it is probable that the
       names of some protein entries that you are using have changed. It
       is therefore useful to remind our users that we provide a tool,
       the
  <a href="http://www.expasy.org/cgi-bin/idtracker">
   IDtracker
  </a>
  which allows to
       trace the identifiers (ID) of protein entries. You can
       use this tool to enquire on the whereabouts of one or more entry
       names and to obtain the newly assigned names and primary accession
      numbers.
 </p>
 <p>
  It can seem paradoxical that we insist in warning users that they
        should
  <strong>
   always use accession numbers when citing an entry
  </strong>
  , yet we
        strive to provide meaningful entry names. The reason for this
        dichotomy is simple: if you want to refer to specific entries in a
        publication or in any document , you need to ensure that your
        reference is stable, unique and unambiguous. Such a mechanism is
        provided by the accession numbers. Accession numbers are stable
        identifiers and you can be sure that you will be always able to track
        down a specific entry if you use an accession number. But when you
        want to access an entry from a web server or a sequence analysis
        program, then it is much easier to remember an entry name than an
        accession number. The human mind is structured in such a way that is
        generally easier for most of us to remember something like
      "APOA5_HUMAN" rather than something like "Q6Q788".
