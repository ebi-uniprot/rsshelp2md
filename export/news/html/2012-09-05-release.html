  Like all other cellular organisms, bacteria and archaea are constantly bombarded by viruses, and unlike eukaryotes, many are also susceptible to infective plasmids. While we have known about defenses such as restriction-modification systems, blockage of absorption and/or
  <span class="caps">
   DNA
  </span>
  injection and abortive infection for some time, new ways in which bacteria and archaea defend themselves against these infective agents have been found more recently. One of these is the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) sequences.
  <span class="caps">
   CRISPR
  </span>
  is an

   RNA

  <span class="caps">
   RNA

  interference (RNAi) and the proteins involved in prokaryotes are not homologous to those in eukaryotes (

  CRISPRs are repetitive loci on the genome consisting of unique sequences 20-50 bases long (the spacer sequences) interspaced with repeated sequences of about the same length. Examination of the spacer sequences has shown that some are identical to viral and plasmid sequences; they are thought to serve as a “memory” of a previous infection. Bacteria and archaea can have from 0 to 18
  <span class="caps">
   CRISPR
  </span>
  loci, with between 2 and 249 repeat-spacer units. While many pathogens have
  <span class="caps">
   CRISPR
  </span>

 <p>
  There are a large number of proteins associated with
  <span class="caps">
   CRISPR
  </span>
  loci, the operon-encoded
  <span class="caps">

  -associated or Cas proteins. The Cas proteins present in each locus have allowed the definition of

  with further division into a number of subtypes. The number of subtypes will probably continue to increase as more prokaryotic genomes are fully sequenced. Many of these proteins are predicted to be nucleases, helicases and/or
