                             1. Introduction


    TrEMBL is a computer-annotated protein sequence database supplementing the
    SWISS-PROT Protein Knowledgebase. TrEMBL contains the translations of
    all coding sequences (CDS) present in the EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ Nucleotide
    Sequence Databases and also protein sequences extracted from the literature
    or submitted to SWISS-PROT, which are not yet integrated into SWISS-PROT.
    TrEMBL can be considered as a preliminary section of SWISS-PROT. For all
    TrEMBL entries which should finally be upgraded to the standard SWISS-PROT
    quality, SWISS-PROT accession numbers have been assigned.

                            2. Why a supplement to SWISS-PROT?

    The ongoing gene sequencing and mapping projects have dramatically
    increased the number of protein sequences to be incorporated into SWISS-PROT.
    We do not want to dilute the quality standards of SWISS-PROT by incorporating
    sequences without proper sequence analysis and annotation, but we do want to
    make the sequences available as quickly as possible. TrEMBL achieves this
    second goal, and is a major step in the process of speeding up subsequent
    upgrading of annotation to the standard SWISS-PROT quality.
    To address the problem of redundancy, the translations of all coding
    sequences (CDS) in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database already included
    in SWISS-PROT have been removed from TrEMBL.


                                 3. The Release

    This TrEMBL release was created from the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database
    release 72 and contains 821'014 entries and 36'790'365 amino acids. To
    minimize redundancy, the translations of all coding sequences (CDS) in the
    EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database already included in SWISS-PROT release 40
    and updates until 25.10.02 have been removed from TrEMBL release 22.

    TrEMBL is split in two main sections: SP-TrEMBL and REM-TrEMBL:
    SP-TrEMBL (SWISS-PROT TrEMBL) contains the entries (734'427) which should be
    eventually incorporated into SWISS-PROT. SWISS-PROT accession numbers have
    been assigned for all SP-TrEMBL entries.

    SP-TrEMBL is organized in subsections:

    arc.dat (Archaea):                          1694 entries
    arp.dat (Complete Archaeal proteomes):     32840 entries
    fun.dat (Fungi):                           19843 entries
    hum.dat (Human):                           39753 entries
    inv.dat (Invertebrates):                   84525 entries
    mam.dat (Other Mammals):                   11880 entries
    mhc.dat (MHC proteins):                     8701 entries
    org.dat (Organelles):                      89635 entries
    phg.dat (Bacteriophages):                   6585 entries
    pln.dat (Plants):                          98105 entries
    pro.dat (Prokaryotes):                     86915 entries
    prp.dat (Complete Prokaryotic Proteomes): 161638 entries
    rod.dat (Rodents):                         32982 entries
    unc.dat (Unclassified):                      149 entries
    vrl.dat (Viruses):                         85797 entries
    vrt.dat (Other Vertebrates):               14095 entries
    vrv.dat (Retroviruses):                    82256 entries

    72'120 new entries have been integrated in SP-TrEMBL. The sequences of
    4357 SP-TrEMBL entries have been updated and the annotation has been
    updated in 334'435 entries.

    In the document deleteac.txt, you will find a list of all accession numbers
    which were previously present in TrEMBL, but which have now been deleted from
    the database.

    REM-TrEMBL (REMaining TrEMBL) contains the entries (86'587) that we do
    not want to include in SWISS-PROT. REM-TrEMBL entries do not have SWISS-PROT
    accession numbers. Instead the stable ID portion of the protein_id present
    in the source EMBL/DDBJ/GenBank nucleotide sequence database entries is
    used as the ID and accession number.This section is organized in six
    subsections:

       1) Immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors (Immuno.dat)
          Most REM-TrEMBL entries are  immunoglobulins and  T-cell receptors. We
          stopped entering immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors into SWISS-PROT,
          because we only want to keep  the  germ line gene derived translations
          of these proteins in SWISS-PROT and not all known somatic recombinated
          variations of  these proteins.  We would like to  create a specialized
          database  dealing  with  these  sequences  as a further  supplement to
          SWISS-PROT  and  keep  only a  representative  cross-section of  these
          proteins in SWISS-PROT.

       2) Synthetic sequences (Synth.dat)
          Another category of data, which will not be included in SWISS-PROT are
          synthetic sequences.  Again, we do not want to  leave these entries in
          TrEMBL. Ideally one should build a specialized database for artificial
          sequences as a further supplement to SWISS-PROT.

       3) Patent application sequences (Patent.dat)
          A third  subsection consists of  coding sequences captured from patent
          applications.  A thorough  survey of  these  entries  have shown  that
          apart from a rather small minority  (which in  most cases have already
          been integrated in SWISS-PROT), most of these sequences contain either
          erroneous data or concern artificially generated sequences outside the
          scope of SWISS-PROT.

       4) Small fragments (Smalls.dat)
          Another  subsection  consists of fragments  with less than eight amino
          acids.

       5) CDS not coding for real proteins (Pseudo.dat)
          This subsection consists of CDS translations where we have strong
          evidence to believe that these CDS are not coding for real proteins.

       6) Truncated proteins (Truncated.dat)
          The last subsection consists of truncated proteins which result from
          events like mutations introducing a stop codon leading to the truncation
          of the protein product.

                    4. Format Differences Between SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL

    The format and conventions used by TrEMBL follow as closely as possible
    that of SWISS-PROT. Hence, it is not necessary to produce an additional
    user manual and extensive release notes for TrEMBL. The information given
    in the SWISS-PROT release notes and user manual are in general valid for
    TrEMBL. The differences are mentioned below.

    The general structure of an entry is identical in SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL.
    The data class used in TrEMBL (in the ID line) is always 'PRELIMINARY',
    whereas in SWISS-PROT it is always 'STANDARD'.

    Differences in line types present in SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL:

    The ID line (IDentification):

    The entry name used in SP-TrEMBL is the same as the Accession Number of the
    entry. The entry name used in REM-TrEMBL is the stable part of the protein_id
    tagged to the corresponding CDS in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database.
    'protein_id' stands for the "Protein Identification" number. It is a number
    that you will find in the feature table of the EMBL nucleotide sequence
    entries in a qualifier called "/protein_id" which is tagged to every CDS.

    Example:

    FT   CDS             339..1514
    FT                   /codon_start=1
    FT                   /db_xref="PID:g1256015"
    FT                   /product="dystrobrevin-epsilon"
    FT                   /protein_id="AAC50431.1"

    The protein_id is defined as follows in the The DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank Feature Table
    Definition documentation
    Qualifier          /protein_id
    Definition         Protein Identifier, issued by International collaborators.
                       This qualifier consists of a stable ID portion (3+5 format
                       with 3 position letters and 5 numbers) plus a version
                       number after the decimal point.

    Value format       <identifier>
    Example            /protein_id="AAA12345.1"
    Comment            When the protein sequence encoded by the CDS changes, only
                       the version number of the /protein_id value is incremented.
                       The stable part of the /protein_id remains unchanged and
                       as a result will permanently be associated with a given
                       protein. This qualifier is valid only on CDS features
                       which translate into a valid protein.


    The DT line (DaTe)

    The format of the DT lines that serve to indicate when an entry was
    created and updated are identical to that defined in SWISS-PROT; but the
    DT lines in TrEMBL refer to the TrEMBL release. The difference is
    shown in the example below.

        DT lines in a SWISS-PROT entry:

        DT   01-JAN-1988 (Rel. 06, Created)
        DT   01-JUL-1989 (Rel. 11, Last sequence update)
        DT   01-AUG-1992 (Rel. 23, Last annotation update)

        DT lines in a TrEMBL entry:

        DT   01-NOV-1996 (TrEMBLrel. 01, Created)
        DT   01-NOV-1996 (TrEMBLrel. 01, Last sequence update)
        DT   01-FEB-1997 (TrEMBLrel. 02, Last annotation update)

                    5. Weekly updates of TrEMBL and non-redundant data sets

    Weekly cumulative updates of TrEMBL are available by anonymous FTP and
    from the EBI SRS server.

    We also produce every week a complete non-redundant protein sequence
    collection by providing three compressed files (these are in the directory
    /pub/databases/sp_tr_nrdb on the EBI FTP server and in databases/sp_tr_nrdb
    on the ExPASy server): sprot.dat.gz, trembl.dat.gz and trembl_new.dat.gz.
    This set of non-redundant files is especially important for two types of
    users:
    (i) Managers of similarity search services. They can now provide what is
    currently the most comprehensive and non-redundant data set of protein
    sequences.
    (ii) Anybody wanting to update their full copy of SWISS-PROT + TrEMBL to
    their own schedule without having to wait for full releases of SWISS-PROT
    or TrEMBL.

    We have also introduced Varsplic Expand which is a program to generate
    "expanded" sequences from SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL records i.e. sequences
    including the variants specified by the varsplic, variant and conflict
    annotations. New records are produced in either pseudo-SWISS-PROT or
    FASTA format for each specified variant. More information and the data is
    available at ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/sp_tr_nrdb/

                    6. Access/Data Distribution

    FTP server:     ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/trembl
    SRS server:     http://srs.ebi.ac.uk/

    TrEMBL is also available on the SWISS-PROT CD-ROM.
    SWISS-PROT + TrEMBL is searchable on the following servers at the EBI:

    FASTA3  (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/fasta33/)
    BLAST2  (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/blast2/)
    Bic_sw  (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/bic_sw/)
    Scanps  (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/scanps/)
    MPSrch  (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/MPsrch/)

    For each TrEMBL release, a synchronized version of the concurrent SWISS-PROT
    release is distributed at ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/trembl/swissprot/

     7. Planned changes


    7.1 Evidence tags:

        We are continuing with the introduction of evidence tags to SWISS-PROT and
        TrEMBL entries. The aim of this is to allow users to see where data items
        came from and to enable SWISS-PROT staff to automatically update data if
        the underlying evidence changes. This is ongoing internally and we hope
        to provide a public version in 2002. For more information,
        please see
        ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/trembl/evidenceDocumentation.html
        We would welcome any feedback from the user community.

    7.2 Conversion of TrEMBL to mixed case:

        Most of the DE (DEscription), GN (Gene Name), RC (Reference Comment)
        and CC (Comment) lines have been converted to mixed case internally. The
        conversion is ongoing and will be made public as the conversion of each
        line type reaches a satisfactory stage. A mixed case version of the DE
        line was made public in last release.

    7.3 Version of TrEMBL in XML format:

        A pre-prelease version of TrEMBL in XML format has been developed and is
        provided with this release of TrEMBL.This will be provided in the future
        for SWISS-PROT as well. More information is available at
        http://www.ebi.ac.uk/swissprot/SP-ML and the data can be downloaded
        from ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/trembl/xml
        We would welcome any feedback from the user community.
