### The smoke's devils

The first written evidence of the therapeutic and psychoactive use of [*Cannabis*](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/3483 "marijuana") is attributed to the legendary emperor of China [Shen-nung](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shennong) who lived some 5,000 years ago. He stated in his famous herbal “Pen-ts’ao Ching” that “the fruits of hemp, if taken in excess will allow ‘seeing devils’. If taken over a long term, it makes one communicate with spirits and lightens one’s body” (in [An archaeological and historical account of *Cannabis* in China](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02862859?LI=true#page-1) ). Until 1942, *Cannabis* was listed in the United States Pharmacopoeia and it was only in 1971 that most European countries banned *Cannabis* by adopting the [Convention on Psychotropic Substances](http://www.unodc.org/pdf/convention_1971_en.pdf) established by the United Nations.

Although marijuana has been used for centuries, the biological processes underlying its psychoactive effects have long remained a mystery. It is only recently that the cannabinoid biosynthetic pathway has been elucidated. The production of *Cannabis* ’ major psychoactive ingredient, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), starts with the condensation of hexanoyl-CoA with three molecules of malonyl-CoA to yield olivetolic acid (OA). It was postulated that a type

III polyketide synthase was catalyzing this reaction, although all type

III PKSs from *Cannabis* characterized so far were only able to produce byproducts instead of OA. [A few months ago](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22802619) , it was shown that the inability of

OLS /TKS , a cloned tetraketide synthase, to synthesize OA was due to the absence of an accessory protein, [olivetolic acid cyclase](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=I6WU39) . In the presence of olivetolic acid cyclase, OA is synthesized. It is then [geranylated to form cannabigerolic acid](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=3411943_pnas.1200330109fig01.jpg "CBGA") , which is further converted by oxidocyclase enzymes to the major cannabinoids, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) in “drug-type” *Cannabis* and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) in “fiber-type” *Cannabis* .

THCA and

CBDA are decarboxylated by a non-enzymatic reaction during storage or smoking to give rise to their chemically neutral forms,

THC (the neurologically active substance) and

CBD , respectively.

Thanks to the recent publication of the [complete sequence of the genome of *Cannabis sativa*](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22014239) , most enzymes involved in the

THC /CBD biosynthetic pathway have been identified and manually annotated in [UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=Q8GTB6+OR+Q33DQ2+OR+A6P6V9+OR+B1Q2B6+OR+I6WU39) .
