### 10'000 mouse entries

The threshold of [10'000 mouse entries](http://www.expasy.org/sprot/hpi/hpi_stat.html#mouse) is about to be reached in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. 35% of them contain information about isoforms generated by alternative splicing. When these are taken into account, the total number of mouse sequences in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot is close to 13'000. The second most represented rodent is UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot is rat with about 4'600 entries.

The majority of the mouse entries contain sequence data generated by one of the two high-throughput cDNA sequencing projects: the [NIH Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC)](http://mgc.nci.nih.gov/) and the [RIKEN](http://genome.gsc.riken.go.jp/) (Rikagaku Kenkyusho, Institute of Physical and Chemical Research) mouse full-length cDNA encyclopedia. 97% of the entries also include cross-references to the [Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) database](http://www.informatics.jax.org/) which provides access to additional data on the genetics, genomics and biology of the laboratory mouse.

Our aim is to annotate all mouse proteins along with the orthologous sequences in other mammals, especially homo sapiens, in order to provide a complete and comprehensive view of mammalian proteomes.

### Annotation changes concerning the feature key METAL

The feature key METAL describes the binding of metal ions. More than 1 metal ion could be listed in the description field, when more than one ion binds to the same sequence residue. We have now restricted the annotation to only 1 metal ion per FT METAL line. Example:

    FT   METAL        61     61       Copper and zinc.

became:

    FT   METAL        61     61       Copper.
    FT   METAL        61     61       Zinc.
