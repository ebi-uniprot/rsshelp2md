### An old-timer, but still trendy: 10’000 entries for Arabidopsis thaliana in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot

[*Arabidopsis thaliana*](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/3702) belongs to the Brassicaceae family that includes the well-known dietary staples cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, turnip, radish, canola and mustard. The split between the Arabidopsis group and the other crops of the genus Brassica has been estimated at around [43 million years ago](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20921408) . *A. thaliana* has been widely studied since the 1980s, when the development of [T-DNA mediated transformation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16453562) made the generation of mutants and their study relatively easy. Since then, *A. thaliana* has been become the model of choice for the study of many biological processes of flowering plants, as well as those specific to the Brassica species.

Its utility as a model organism was further boosted by the completion of the [whole genome sequence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11130711) , which revealed a relatively small genome with a low level of duplication compared to other flowering plants, and by the inception of a number of complementary efforts to sequence the transcriptome.

In 2001, the Swiss-Prot group created the Plant Proteome Annotation Program (

PPAP ) whose main focus is the annotation of proteins and protein families of *A. thaliana* and rice. One decade on, we have now annotated over [10’000 *A. thaliana* entries](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=organism:3702+AND+reviewed:yes) in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. This corresponds to around 36% of the *A. thaliana* proteome according to [version 10 *Arabidopsis thaliana* genome annotation](http://www.arabidopsis.org/doc/news/breaking_news/140) from The Arabidopsis Information Resource (

TAIR ), which estimates at 27’416 the number of protein-coding genes in this organism. According to the Multinational Arabidopsis Steering Committee (MASC) [report 2010](http://www.arabidopsis.org/portals/masc/masc_docs/masc_reports.jsp) , at least one third of these genes still have no known function, so the work of experimentally characterizing and of annotating each gene is far from finished.

[All manually annotated *A.thaliana* entries](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=organism:3702+AND+reviewed:yes) can be retrieved from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot using the organism name " *Arabidopsis thaliana* " (or the taxonomy identifier 3702), with the restriction: “reviewed:yes”.

## UniProtKB news

### Cross-references to Allergome

Cross-references have been added to [Allergome](http://www.allergome.org/) , a platform for allergen knowledge.

Allergome is available at <http://www.allergome.org/> .

The format of the explicit link in the flat file is:

<table><colgroup><col style="width: 45%" /><col style="width: 54%" /></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Resource abbreviation</td><td>Allergome</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Resource identifier</td><td>Allergome unique identifier</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Optional information 1</td><td>Allergen name</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Example</td><td><p>O76821</p><pre><code>DR   Allergome; 2; Aca s 13.
DR   Allergome; 3051; Aca s 13.0101.</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
