### Inflammation: the Good, the Bad and the Ugly

In a world filled with (microbial) foes, inflammation is our best friend, helping us fight against invading microorganisms, promoting wound healing and tissue regeneration. When it gets out of hand, however, it becomes our worst enemy. For instance, inflammation is required for mice to fight [Influenza virus A](https://viralzone.expasy.org/6?outline=all%5Fby%5Fspecies) (IAV) infections, but [animals challenged with high doses of virus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32200799) experience elevated levels of inflammation, destruction of airway epithelia and eventually die, unless they are deficient in [MLKL protein](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=accession:Q8NB16+OR+accession:Q9D2Y4) , an endogenous protein that induces cell death in response to orthomyxovirus infection.

[The mechanism leading to this fatal issue has been recently elucidated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32200799) . When IAV infects cells and replicates, newly formed IAV RNA duplexes can adopt the Z-confirmation. These very peculiar RNAs are recognized by [ZBP1 protein](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=accession:Q9H171+OR+accession:Q9QY24+OR+accession:Q8VDA5) as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and initiate a cascade of reactions. Activated ZBP1 recruits [RIPK3](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=accession:Q9Y572+OR+accession:Q9QZL0+OR+accession:Q9Z2P5) , which in turn [can induce one of two forms of programmed cell death](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27321907/) , apoptosis and pro-inflammatory necroptosis. In the presence of RIPK1, apoptosis is favored. In the absence of RIPK1, RIPK3 phosphorylates [MLKL](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=accession:Q8NB16+OR+accession:Q9D2Y4) , which then induces necroptosis. Programmed cell death is an effective mechanism of [IAV clearance that not only eliminates infected cells to limit virus spread but also serves to catalyze adaptive immune responses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32200799) . When cell death is unrestrained, or when the mode of cell death is primarily necrotic, then injury and severe illness ensue, despite virus clearance.

The dark side of inflammation also includes chronic inflammatory diseases and although progress has been made in this field, the causes that initiate pathogenic inflammatory responses still remain elusive. Could ZBP1 be a player in this deadly game? In other words, can ZBP1 be activated in the absence of any viral infections? An answer to these questions came from a recent publication by [Jiao et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32296175) . The authors showed that endogenous retroelements (EREs) produce double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) adopting a Z-confirmation. These dsRNAs are recognized by ZBP1 and activate it. EREs derive either from ancient retroviral infections or from active retrotransposons and constitute over half of the human and mouse genomes. Most dsRNAs identified by Jiao et al. originate from B2 and Alu short interspersed nuclear elements, followed by long interspersed nuclear elements (specifically, L1 elements) and long terminal repeat elements. Hence, these old mates of ours may still be able to mimic viral infections. Indeed in RIPK1 knockout mice, deregulation of ERE expression may trigger ZBP1-dependent skin inflammation. This mechanism may be relevant for the pathogenesis of inflammatory pathologies in humans, particularly in patients with variations in proteins that inhibit the ZBP1-MLKL-induced necroptotic pathway, such as RIPK1.

As of this release, [ZBP1](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=accession:Q9H171+OR+accession:Q9QY24+OR+accession:Q8VDA5) , [RIPK3](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=accession:Q9Y572+OR+accession:Q9QZL0+OR+accession:Q9Z2P5) , and [MLKL](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=accession:Q8NB16+OR+accession:Q9D2Y4) have been updated and are available in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.

### Cross-references to PathwayCommons

Cross-references have been added to the PathwayCommons, a resource that aims to collect and disseminate biological pathway and interaction data. Data is collected from partner databases and is represented in the BioPAX standard. By representing data in BioPAX, Pathway Commons is able to provide a detailed representation of a variety of biological concepts including: Biochemical reactions; gene regulatory networks; and genetic interactions; transport and catalysis events; and physical interactions involving proteins, DNA, RNA and small molecules and complexes.

### Change to the cross-references to GlyConnect

We have introduced an additional field in the cross-references to the [GlyConnect protein glycosylation database](https://glyconnect.expasy.org) , a platform integrating sources of information to help characterize the molecular components of protein glycosylation. This allows us to provide some additional information, e.g. about the nature of the glycans and the number of glycosylation sites.

### New automatic annotation system ARBA (Association-Rule-Based Annotator)

In the UniProt [Automatic Annotation pipeline](http://www.uniprot.org/help/automatic%5Fannotation) which enhances unreviewed (UniProtKB/TrEMBL) records by enriching them with automatic classification and annotation, the SAAS (Statistical Automatic Annotation System) component has been superseded by the more powerful [ARBA (Association-Rule-Based Annotator)](http://www.uniprot.org/help/arba) . ARBA is a multiclass learning system trained on expertly annotated entries in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. ARBA uses rule mining techniques to generate concise annotation models with the highest representativeness and coverage for annotation, based on the properties of [InterPro](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro) group membership and taxonomy. ARBA employs a data exclusion set that censors data not suitable for computational annotation (such as specific biophysical or chemical properties) and generates human-readable rules for each release. ARBA rules can be [browsed and searched](http://www.uniprot.org/arba) via the website.
