### Two new completely annotated microbial proteomes

In the framework of the [HAMAP project](http://www.expasy.org/sprot/hamap/) we not only annotate specified [microbial protein families](http://www.expasy.org/sprot/hamap/families.html) , but we also aim to completely annotate all the proteins from a number of selected microbial genomes.

We maintain pages that list complete [bacterial](http://www.expasy.org/sprot/hamap/bacteria.html) and [archaeal](http://www.expasy.org/sprot/hamap/archaea.html) proteomes and which report the status of completion of the annotations in Swiss-Prot.

We have now completed the annotation of two more microbial genomes, namely those of *Buchnera aphidicola (subsp. Baizongia pistaciae)* and *Methanococcus jannaschii* . The total number of microbial genomes where all proteins are annotated in Swiss-Prot is now 8 and more are yet to come.

## UniProtKB news

### Cross-references to Structural and functional annotation of *Arabidopsis thaliana* gene and protein families (GeneFarm)

We have added cross-references to the Structural and functional annotation of *Arabidopsis thaliana* gene and protein families (GeneFarm), available at <http://genoplante-info.infobiogen.fr/Genefarm/index.htpl> .

The identifiers of the appropriate DR line are:

<table><colgroup><col style="width: 45%" /><col style="width: 55%" /></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Resource abbreviation</td><td>GeneFarm</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Resource identifier</td><td>GeneFarm's unique identifier for a gene.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Optional information 1</td><td>GeneFarm's identifier for a gene family.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Example</td><td><pre><code>O04500:
DR   GeneFarm; 1671; 91.</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Changes concerning the [controlled vocabulary for PTMs](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/ptmlist)

We are continuously overhauling the annotation of post-translational modifications (PTMs). Sulfation sites are described in the description field of the feature key MOD\_RES, all entries with such a site contain the keyword 'Sulfation'. The initially defined controlled vocabulary for sulfation sites is listed below:

    Sulfotyrosine
    Sulfoserine
    Sulfothreonine
