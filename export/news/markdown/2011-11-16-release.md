## Headline

Who wants to be a millionaire? The first million

HAMAP -annotated entries in UniProtKB/TrEMBL

As humanity explores more environmental and ecological niches, we are discovering a treasure-trove of organisms of which very little, if anything, is known. Sequencing genomes is becoming cheaper, and so to understand this diversity we sequence; but to begin to appreciate a genome’s possibilities quality annotation is required.

HAMAP is an annotation project started over 10 years ago to provide annotation to the massive influx of completely sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes and is now an integral part of the UniProt [Automatic Annotation program](http://www.uniprot.org/help/automatic_annotation) .

The

HAMAP rules automatically annotate bacterial and archaeal proteins, as well as related plastid-encoded proteins, based on manually-annotated, characterized template entries. These latter entries are used to generate the

HAMAP profiles. UniProtKB/TrEMBL entries that belong to a family, i.e. that match a

HAMAP profile, acquire annotation based on the manually annotated templates as well as template-based feature propagation. The propagated annotation also includes protein and gene names, general annotation (comments), keywords and GO terms. The annotation templates (http://hamap.expasy.org/families.html), seed alignments used to generate the

HAMAP profiles and much more are available on the

HAMAP website and will be integrated into the www.uniprot.org automatic annotation portal in the future.

Two years ago we wrote a [headline](http://www.uniprot.org/news/2009/09/22/release) highlighting the incorporation of

300,000

HAMAP annotated entries into UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot . Since that time we have discontinued incorporation of these semi-automatically annotated entries into UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot; this annotation is now added to UniProtKB/TrEMBL entries instead, while manually annotated ‘template’ entries (see above) are still integrated into UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. With this release there are [over 1 million bacterial, archaeal and plastid-encoded proteins in UniProtKB/TrEMBL](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=source:HAMAP+reviewed:no) that have been annotated by the

HAMAP rules. With each UniProt release, and as families and new template entries are created or updated based on new experiments, entries from all genomes are (re)annotated, enriching them beyond what was known when the genomes were originally submitted to the

DNA databases. All these entries are thus improved by this high quality semi-automated annotation, rendering them more useful to the community.

## UniProtKB news

### Cross-references to KO (KEGG Orthology)

Cross-references have been added to [KO](http://www.genome.jp/kegg/ko.html) consisting of manually defined ortholog groups that correspond to

KEGG pathway nodes,

BRITE hierarchy nodes, and

KEGG module nodes.

KO is available at <http://www.genome.jp/kegg/ko.html> .

The format of the explicit links in the flat file is:

<table><colgroup><col style="width: 50%" /><col style="width: 50%" /></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Resource abbreviation</td><td>KO</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Resource identifier</td><td>KO identifier</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Example</td><td><p>P41932 :</p><pre><code>DR   KO; K06630; -.</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>

[Show all the entries having a cross-reference to KO](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=database:ko) .

### Changes to [keywords](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/keywlist)

New keyword:

-   [Ciliopathy](http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-1186)

### Changes in the [controlled vocabulary for PTMs](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/ptmlist)

New term for the feature key ‘Modified residue’ (‘MOD\_RES’ in the flat file):

-   4-hydroxyglutamate

New terms for the feature key ‘Cross-link’ (‘CROSSLNK’ in the flat file):

-   3-hydroxypyridine-2,5-dicarboxylic acid (Ser-Cys) (with S-...)
-   3-hydroxypyridine-2,5-dicarboxylic acid (Ser-Ser) (with C-...)
-   Thiazole-4-carboxylic acid (Glu-Cys)
