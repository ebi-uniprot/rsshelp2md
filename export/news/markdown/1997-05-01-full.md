                                   1. Introduction



    TREMBL is a computer-annotated protein sequence database supplementing the
    SWISS-PROT Protein Sequence Data Bank. TREMBL contains the translations of
    all coding sequences (CDS) present in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database
    not yet integrated in SWISS-PROT. TREMBL can be considered as a preliminary
    section of SWISS-PROT. For all TREMBL entries which should finally be
    upgraded to the standard SWISS-PROT quality, SWISS-PROT accession numbers
    have been assigned.


                            2. Why a supplement to SWISS-PROT?

    The ongoing genome sequencing and mapping projects have dramatically
    increased the number of protein sequences to be incorporated into SWISS-PROT.
    We do not want to dilute the quality standards of SWISS-PROT by incorporating
    sequences without proper sequence analysis and annotation, but we do want to
    make the sequences available as fast as possible. TREMBL achieves this second
    goal, and is a major step in the process of speeding up subsequent
    upgrading of annotation to the standard SWISS-PROT quality.
    To address the problem of redundancy, the translations of all coding
    sequences (CDS) in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database already included
    in SWISS-PROT have been removed from TREMBL.

    We name this supplement TREMBL (TRanslation from EMBL), since the tools
    used to create the translations of the CDS are based on the program
    'trembl' written by Thure Etzold at the EMBL.


                                 3. The Release

    This TREMBL release is created from the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database
    release 50 and contains 126'995 sequence entries, comprising 34'178'645
    amino acids. To minimize redundancy, the translations of all coding
    sequences (CDS) in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database already included
    in SWISS-PROT Release 34 and in SWISS-PROT updates by 19.5. have been
    removed from TREMBL release 3.

    TREMBL is split into two main sections; SP-TREMBL and REM-TREMBL:

    SP-TREMBL (SWISS-PROT TREMBL) contains the entries (104'865) which should be
    eventually incorporated into SWISS-PROT. SWISS-PROT accession numbers have
    been assigned for all SP-TREMBL entries.

    SP-TREMBL is organized in subsections:

    fun.dat (Fungi):                3425 entries
    hum.dat (Human):                5126 entries
    inv.dat (Invertebrates):       14229 entries
    mam.dat (Other Mammals):        1958 entries
    mhc.dat (MHC proteins):         2537 entries
    org.dat (Organelles):           7313 entries
    phg.dat (Bacteriophages):        883 entries
    pln.dat (Plants):               6812 entries
    pro.dat (Prokaryotes):         23718 entries
    rod.dat (Rodents):              5118 entries
    unc.dat (Unclassified):           39 entries
    vrl.dat (Viruses):             31052 entries
    vrt.dat (Other Vertebrates):    2655 entries

    REM-TREMBL (REMaining TREMBL) contains the entries (22'130) that we do
    not want to include in SWISS-PROT. REM-TREMBL entries have no accession
    numbers. This section is organized in five subsections:

       1) Immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors
          Most REM-TREMBL entries will be immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors.
          We stopped entering  immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors into SWISS-
          PROT, because we only   want to  keep  the  germ  line  gene  derived
          translations of  these proteins  in  SWISS-PROT  and  not  all  known
          somatic recombinated  variations of  these proteins. We would like to
          create  a  specialized  database  dealing  with these sequences as  a
          further  supplement to  SWISS-PROT and  keep  only  a  representative
          cross-section of these proteins in SWISS-PROT.

       2) Synthetic sequences
          Another category of data which will not be included in SWISS-PROT are
          synthetic sequences.  Again, we do not want to leave these entries in
          TREMBL.  Ideally   one  should   build  a  specialized  database  for
          artificial sequences as a further supplement to SWISS-PROT.

       3) Patent application sequences
          A third  subsection consists  of coding sequences captured from patent
          applications. A thorough survey of these entries have shown that apart
          from a rather small  minority (which in  most cases  have already been
          integrated  in SWISS-PROT),  most of  these sequence  contains  either
          erroneous data or concern artificially generated sequences outside the
          scope of SWISS-PROT.

       4) Small fragments
          Another  subsection consists  of fragments with less than seven amino
          acids.

       5) CDS not coding for real proteins
          The last subsection consists of CDS translations where we have strong
          evidence to believe that these CDS are not coding for real proteins.


               4. Format Differences Between SWISS-PROT and TREMBL

    The format and conventions used by TREMBL follow as closely as possible
    that of SWISS-PROT. Hence, it is not necessary to produce an additional
    user manual and extensive release notes for TREMBL. The information given
    in the SWISS-PROT release notes and user manual are in general valid for
    TREMBL. The differences are mentioned below.

    The general structure of an entry is identical in SWISS-PROT and TREMBL.
    The data class used in TREMBL (in the ID line) is always 'PRELIMINARY',
    whereas in SWISS-PROT it is always 'STANDARD'.

    Differences in line types present in SWISS-PROT and TREMBL:

    The ID line (IDentification):

    The entry name used in SP-TREMBL is the same as the Accession Number of the
    entry. The entry name used in REM-TREMBL is the PID tagged to the
    corresponding CDS in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database. 'PID' stands for
    the "Protein IDentification" number. It is a number that you will find in
    EMBL nucleotide sequence entries in a qualifier called "/db_xref" which is
    tagged to every CDS in the nucleotide database. Example:

       FT   CDS            54..1382
       FT                  /note="ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/
       FT                  oxygenase activase precursor"
       FT                  /db_xref="PID:g1006835"

    The DT line (DaTe)

    The format of the DT lines that serve to indicate when an entry was
    created and updated are identical to that defined in SWISS-PROT; but the
    DT lines in TREMBL are referring to the TREMBL release. The difference is
    shown in the example below.

        DT lines in a SWISS-PROT entry:

        DT   01-JAN-1988 (REL. 06, CREATED)
        DT   01-JUL-1989 (REL. 11, LAST SEQUENCE UPDATE)
        DT   01-AUG-1992 (REL. 23, LAST ANNOTATION UPDATE)

        DT lines in a TREMBL entry:

        DT   01-NOV-1996 (TREMBLREL. 01, CREATED)
        DT   01-NOV-1996 (TREMBLREL. 01, LAST SEQUENCE UPDATE)
        DT   01-FEB-1997 (TREMBLREL. 02, LAST ANNOTATION UPDATE)
