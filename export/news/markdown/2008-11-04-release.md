### One thousand legs and a few toxins

Have you ever faced an elongated and dorso-ventrally flattened arthropod? If yes, it could have been a scolopendra or one of its cousins of the "numberless feet" family, i.e.Â the Myriapoda subphylum. If you were lucky enough not to be stung, you avoided intense local or irradiating pain, redness, edema, local hyperthermia, superficial necrosis, or even systemic symptoms such as nausea, emesis, sudoresis, anxiety and depression.

What is the cause of these symptoms? Information about scolopendra venom composition is very limited, probably due to the lack of severe systemic symptoms and fatalities in adults. However, in 2007, a group of researchers studied the neglected group of scolopenders (see [Rates et al., 2007](http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17320133) ), using a structure-to-function proteomic approach in order to better understand the complexity of the venoms of two Brazilian scolopendra species: Scolopendra viridicornis nigra and [Scolopendra angulata](http://www.scolopendra.be/scolopendra/angulata1.jpg) . [23 proteins](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=(organism:486497+OR+organism:486498)+AND+reviewed:yes) have been characterized and their N-termini sequenced. As of this release, they are all available in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.

### Cross-references to Xenbase

Cross-references have been added to the [Xenbase](http://www.xenbase.org/) , a Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis biology and genomics resource. Xenbase is a model organism database integrating a diverse array of biological and genomic data on the frogs, Xenopus laevis and Xenopus (Silurana) tropicalis. Data is collected from other databases, high-throughput screens and scientific literature and is integrated into a number of database modules covering subjects such as community, literature, gene and genomic analysis.

The Xenbase resource is available at [http://http://www.xenbase.org/](http://www.xenbase.org/) .
