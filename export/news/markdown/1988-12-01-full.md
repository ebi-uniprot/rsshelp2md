       Date:     December 1, 1988
       Author:   A. Bairoch


                             1. INTRODUCTION

       1.1  Evolution

       Release 9.0  of SWISS-PROT  contains 8702 sequence entries,
       comprising  2'498'140  amino  acids  abstracted  from  8735
       references. This represents an increase of 12% over release
       8.0. The  recent growth  of the  data  bank  is  summarised
       below:

       1.2  Source of data

       Release 9.0  has been  updated using  protein sequence data
       from  release  17.0  of  the  PIR  (Protein  Identification
       Resource) protein  data bank,  as well  as  translation  of
       nucleotide sequence  data from  release 17.0  of  the  EMBL
       nucleotide sequence Data Library.

       As an  indication to the source of the sequence data in the
       SWISS-PROT data bank we list here the statistics concerning
       the DR (Databank Reference) pointer lines:

       Entries with pointer(s) to only PIR entri(es):          3049
       Entries with pointer(s) to only EMBL entri(es):         2640
       Entries with pointer(s) to both EMBL and PIR entri(es): 2532
       Entries with no pointers lines (entered in house):       481


       2. Description  of the  changes made  to  SWISS-PROT  since
          release 8

       2.1  Sequences and annotations

       Some 978  new sequences  have been  added  since  the  last
       release, the sequence data of 111 existing entries has been
       updated and  the annotations  of  1622  entries  have  been
       revised. In  particular we  have used  reviews articles  to
       update the  annotations of the following groups or families
       of proteins:

            Acidic ribosomal proteins
            Adipokinetic hormone family
            ATP synthase subunits
            Bacterial histone-like DNA-binding proteins
            Bombesin-like peptides family
            Chaperonins
            Cholecystokinin/gastrin family
            Ferredoxins
            G-protein coupled receptors
            Histones H2A
            Histones H4
            HIV/SIV viruses proteins
            Homeobox proteins
            Integrins alpha chains
            Intermediate filaments
            Myosin heavy chains
            Myosin light chains
            Ovomucoids
            Oxytocin/vasopressin family
            Potato inhibitor I family
            Prion protein
            Receptor tyrosine-protein kinase class II
            Receptor tyrosine-protein kinase class III
            Ribonucleoproteins
            Serine carboxypeptidases
            Silk moth chorion proteins
            Thiol proteases inhibitors


       2.2  Cross-references to the HIV Sequence Database

       Starting with  release 9  we have added cross-references to
       entries in  the Human  Retroviruses and AIDS compilation of
       nucleic   and    amino   acid   sequences   (HIV   Sequence
       Database)(1). An  example of  a DR  line pointing to an HIV
       entry is shown here:

       DR   HIV; M15654; 3ORF$BH102.


       2.3  New topic for the comments (CC) line type

       As of  release 9  we have  added  a  new  'topic'  for  the
       comments (CC) line-type: ALTERNATIVE SPLICING which is used
       to describe  the existence  of related  protein sequence(s)
       produced by alternative splicing of the same gene(s).

       Example of its usage:

       CC   -!- ALTERNATIVE SPLICING: SKELETAL MUSCLE AND FIBROBLAST
       CC       TROPOMYOSINS ARE OBTAINED BY ALTERNATIVE MRNA SPLICING.


       3. THE NEXT RELEASE

       SWISS-PROT release 10.0 will be available in February 1989.
       We plan to upgrade the OC lines so as to add at least a few
       level of  taxonomic nodes  (currently  only  the  top-node:
       viridae, prokaryota or eukaryota is available).


       4. WE NEED YOUR HELP !

       We welcome any feedback from our users. We especially would
       appreciate that  you notify  us if  you find that sequences
       belonging to  your field  of expertise are missing from the
       data  bank.  We  also  would  like  to  be  notified  about
       annotations to  be updated,  as for example if the function
       of  a   protein  has   been  clarified   or  if  new  post-
       translational information has become available.
