### Swiss-Prot reaches 150'000 entries

With this release the number of Swiss-Prot entries has reached the 150'000 mark. It took about 9.5 years to reach the 50'000 entries mark (January 1996), almost 6 more years to reach 100'000 entries (September 2001) and about 2.5 years to the current 150'000 entries.

The continuous increase in the speed of annotation is due to a number of factors among which the increase in the number of annotators working for Swiss-Prot at SIB and EBI, increase in the productivity of the work of these annotators, the implementation and improvement of software tools that help to automate some annotation tasks, facilitated access to many third party resources, and the gradual rise in quality of the underlying DNA sequences as well as the quality of genomic and cDNA annotation.

### Changes concerning the [controlled vocabulary for PTMs](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/ptmlist)

We are continuously overhauling the annotation of post-translational modifications (PTMs). Methylation sites are described in the description field of the feature key MOD\_RES, all entries with such a site contain the keyword 'Methylation'. The initially defined controlled vocabulary for methylation sites is listed below:

    N-methylalanine
    N,N,N-trimethylalanine
    Omega-N-methylated arginine
    Omega-N-methylarginine
    Asymmetric dimethylarginine
    Symmetric dimethylarginine
    5-methylarginine
    N5-methylarginine
    N4-methylasparagine
    N4,N4-dimethylasparagine
    S-methylcysteine
    Cysteine methyl ester
    2-methylglutamine
    N5-methylglutamine
    Glutamate methyl ester (Gln)
    Glutamate methyl ester (Glu)
    Methylhistidine
    Pros-methylhistidine
    Tele-methylhistidine
    N-methylisoleucine
    N-methylleucine
    Leucine methyl ester
    N6-methylated lysine
    N6-methyllysine
    N6,N6-dimethyllysine
    N6,N6,N6-trimethyllysine
    Lysine methyl ester
    N-methylmethionine
    N-methylphenylalanine
    N,N-dimethylproline
    N-methyltyrosine
