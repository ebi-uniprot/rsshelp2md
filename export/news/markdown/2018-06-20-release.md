## Headline

### Neuronal express mRNA delivery service

In mammals, the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein ARC is a [key regulator of synaptic plasticity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21278731) , being involved in many aspects of synapse formation, maturation, and plasticity, as well as in [learning and memory](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19690847) . ARC expression is known to be induced by synaptic activity and [its mRNA accumulates at sites of local synaptic activity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24671994) where it is locally translated.

ARC originates from the Ty3/Gypsy retrotransposon family and it has retained some retroviral features. Its protein [architecture](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25864631) is remarkably similar to that of the capsid domain of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) GAG protein. GAG proteins are essential for viral infection. They can self-assemble to form capsids and encapsulate genomic RNA via direct sequence-specific interactions. At first glance, these properties do not seem crucial for eukaryotic proteins, but [two recent studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29328916,29328915) unravel a quite unexpected means of neuronal communication, that is reminiscent of viral infection.

The intriguing observation was that ARC protein and mRNA are not only present at synapses, but also enriched in extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by neurons. These EVs are endocytosed by target cells, where ARC mRNA is postsynaptically translated, as has been described both at the *Drosophila* neuromuscular junction (NMJ), between motor neurons and muscles, and in rat hippocampal neurons. How is this achieved? Presynaptic ARC proteins bind the 3'-UTR of ARC mRNA, oligomerize and form capsid-like structures, in which the mRNA is packaged. These eukaryotic 'capsids' are then released by neurons in EVs and they mediate ARC mRNA transfer into postsynaptic target cells. In flies, ARC knockdown in motor neurons results in a decrease in ARC mRNA and protein in muscles, and leads to impaired expansion of the NMJ, synaptic bouton maturation, and activity-dependent synaptic bouton formation. This phenotype is not rescued by the expression of an ARC construct in muscle alone, nor if the neuronal ARC mRNA construct is missing its 3'-UTR. Overall, these data suggest that [it is not just the presence of ARC in presynaptic terminals, but the actual transfer to the postsynaptic region that is required for ARC function](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29328915) .

This exciting piece of information has been transferred to [UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot rat and *Drosophila* ARC entries](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=accession:Q63053+OR+accession:Q7K1U0) by means of the classical pathway of expert curation and, as of this release, the updated records are publicly available.

### International protein nomenclature guidelines

The European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), the Protein Information Resource (PIR) and the Swiss Institute for Bioinformatics (SIB) have worked together to produce **a shared set of protein naming guidelines** . These guidelines are intended for use by anyone who wants to name a protein and aim to promote consistent nomenclature which is indispensable for communication, literature searching and data retrieval. They replace the previous UniProt protein naming guidelines and are [available on the UniProt website](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/International%5FProtein%5FNomenclature%5FGuidelines.pdf) as part of this release.

### UniProt website news

To improve security and privacy, we have moved our web pages and services from HTTP to HTTPS.

The HTTP protocol does not provide encryption - anyone who can see web traffic between a client (e.g. a web browser) and a server can intercept potentially sensitive information and/or inject malware into users' browsers or operating systems. HTTPS solves this problem by encrypting web traffic between a client and a server in both directions, so that observers cannot intercept or tamper with the client's requests or the server's responses. It also provides authentication, ensuring that the client is communicating with the intended server given by the hostname, and not some impostor.

#### Timeline

We supported separate HTTP and HTTPS services until **release 2018\_06 (June 20, 2018)** . From this date, the HTTP traffic is automatically redirected to HTTPS. We intend to maintain these redirects indefinitely, but it is to your advantage to update your applications to use HTTPS as soon as possible, both for performance and security reasons.

#### Interactive users

If you access our pages only through a **Web browser** (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer, Opera, etc.), the only change after the switchover date is that a green lock icon should appear inside the URL box of your browser, and the web addresses of the pages you visit will start with https://. We recommend that you update your bookmarks and links accordingly.

#### Programmatic users

Applications that access web servers using http:// URLs instead of https:// URLs may fail after a switch to HTTPS for the following reasons:

-   Your programming environment's HTTP facility does not automatically follow redirects from HTTP to HTTPS. Some libraries follow redirections from HTTP to HTTPS, others do not (e.g. Java's URLConnection).
-   Your application uses HTTP requests other than GET and HEAD. These requests (including especially POST and PUT) will fail with `HTTP 403 Forbidden` after the switchover date.
-   Your application accesses our servers through a proxy. Check with your proxy vendor about HTTPS support and how to add or update certificates.
-   Your programming environment does not support HTTPS.

After the switchover date, our servers:

-   respond with a server-side redirect ( `HTTP 301 Moved permanently` ) to the corresponding HTTPS URL for HTTP GET and HEAD requests

<!-- -->

-   respond with `HTTP 403 Forbidden` and an error message to all HTTP requests other than GET and HEAD (including and especially HTTP POST).

URLs that start with `http://purl.uniprot.org/` , which are used as URIs in the UniProt [RDF distribution](ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current%5Frelease/rdf/) and [SPARQL service](http://sparql.uniprot.org/) , are redirected to the corresponding HTTPS web page when used in a web context.
