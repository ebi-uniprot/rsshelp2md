### Hydrogenosomal genome encoded proteins

It was recently found (see Nature 434:74-79(2005); [PubMed=15744302](http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15744302) ) that some anaerobic ciliates such as Nyctotherus ovalis (which thrives in the hindgut of cockroaches!) have retained a rudimentary hydrogenosomal genome. Hydrogenosomes are double-membraned subcellular structures that generate hydrogen while making the energy-storage compound ATP. They are found in certain eukaryotic unicellular organisms that inhabit oxygen-deficient environments.

The hydrogenosomal genome of N.ovalis is only 14 kb long and seems to encode for 11 different proteins, among which 5 subunits of the NADH dehydrogenase (complex I) and 2 ribosomal proteins. The genome and the proteins encoded are highly similar to their mitochondrial genome-encoded counterparts, thus establishing an evolutionary link between mitochondria and hydrogenosomes.

We are in the process of annotating the proteins from the N.ovalis hydrogenosomal genome.

This is linked with the introduction of "Hydrogenosome" in the list of valid values in the OG line.
