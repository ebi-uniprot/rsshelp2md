### Magnetic personalities

[Magnetotactic bacteria sense and align to the Earth's magnetic field](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27620945,28754204) , swimming north in the Northern Hemisphere and south in the Southern in the presence of oxygen. This amazing ability to sense the Earth's magnetic field is provided by small organelles, called magnetosomes, formed by iron nanocrystals of either [magnetite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetite) (Fe <sub>3</sub> O <sub>4</sub> ) or [greigite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greigite) (Fe <sub>3</sub> S <sub>4</sub> ) surrounded by a phospholipid bilayer. Generally, magnetosomes form chains that align along the long axis of the cell using a dedicated actin-like cytoskeletal structure.

Magnetosome formation is a complex process, which includes invagination of the cell inner membrane to form vesicles, iron ion uptake, crystal biomineralization and magnetosome chain assembly. It involves a large number of proteins, encoded by genes clustered in an approximately 100 kb magnetosome island. Among all proteins involved in magnetosome formation, one of the single most important is [MamB](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=name%3A%22Magnetosome+protein+MamB%22+AND+reviewed:yes) , a probable iron transporter with a [role in both vesicle formation and biomineralization](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29243866,20212111) . MamB is [stabilized by heterodimerization with MamM](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22007638) . Studies in genetically tractable [*Magnetospirillum magneticum* (strain AMB-1)](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/342108) and [*Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense* (strain MSR)](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/431944) have pinpointed the function of many more proteins. For instance, MamA [forms a scaffold](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21784982) to which other proteins attach on the organelle's exterior. MamI aids in [magnetite nucleation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20212111,27286560) , while MamH is another [probable iron transporter](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23889511) . MamN may [control the pH of the magnetosome lumen](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20212111,27286560) . 4 redox-active multi-heme proteins are probably involved in correct iron oxidization ( [MamP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25775527) , [MamT](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23176475) , [MamX](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24020498) and MamE), the latter is also a protease [necessary for magnetosome protein maturation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27302060) . There are proteins that positively regulate crystal size (including [MamC, MamD MamG, MamF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17965152,22716969) and those that negatively regulate crystal size ( [Mms36 and Mms48](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22043287,24816605) ). Finally MamK is an actin-like protein [involved in organelle positioning](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20487281,24957623) , along with [MamJ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16299495,27733152) .

The interest in magnetosomes goes far beyond the understanding of these fascinating bacteria. Magnetosomes may be instrumental for the improvement of magnetic nanoparticle biotechnologies. Purified bacterial magnetosomes represent magnetic nanoparticles with exceptionally [well-defined characteristics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27620945) , owing to the precise control that is exerted during all stages of biogenesis, and several unprecedented properties, such as high crystallinity, strong magnetization, and a uniform distribution of shape and size that cannot be replicated by synthesis using abiotic processes. In the biomedical field, promising results suggest that magnetosomes could be used in medical imaging, [targeted drug delivery](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23043508) and [tumor hyperthermia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22698862,30168058) . In the context of wastewater treatment, it has been shown that heavy metal ions can be [adsorbed onto magnetosome-producing microorganisms and then removed by magnetic separation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22763846) . In addition, it may also help us learn more about the origin of life and the evolution of membrane-bound eukaryotic organelles.

As of this release nearly 70 magnetosome proteins have been annotated and can be retrieved using the term [magnetosome](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=magnetosome+AND+reviewed:yes) .

## UniRef news

### Change of UniRef clustering method from CD-HIT to MMseqs2

We have switched the clustering program for UniRef90 and UniRef50 from CD-HIT to MMseqs2 ( [Steinegger M. and Soeding J., Nat. Commun. 9 (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-04964-5) ).

The clustering algorithm remains "Greedy Incremental Clustering" with the same parameters (thanks to the MMseqs2 authors for making this available). UniRef100 was not affected.

## UniProt XML news

### Removal of whitespace characters in the XML amino acid sequence representations

The `<sequence>` elements of the UniProtKB, UniParc and UniRef XML representations formatted the amino acid sequence for historic reasons with spaces and newlines. These whitespace characters had to be removed before parsing with native XML tools. To avoid this complication we have removed all whitespace characters in the `<sequence>` elements, so that they contain only [IUPAC](https://iupac.org/) amino acid codes.
