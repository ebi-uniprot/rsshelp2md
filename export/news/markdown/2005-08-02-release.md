### The dramatic outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus may be due to two mutations in the virus spike protein

The [SARS coronavirus](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/227859) is a new human pathogen that emerged in Asia in 2002-2003. The animal reservoir of the virus is presumably [palm civet](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/9675) , whose meat is a delicacy in Southern China.

The virus induces an acute respiratory distress in human and is deadly in 10% of all cases. It enters pulmonary cells through binding of the viral spike protein (human isolate Tor2 and palm civet isolate SZ3: [P59594](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P59594) ) to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (palm civet: [Q56NL1](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q56NL1) ; human: [Q9BYF1](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9BYF1) ). These proteins have recently been annotated or updated in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.

It has been recently shown that two amino acid mutations on palm civet SARS spike protein, Lys-479 and Ser-487, are sufficient for the virus to acquire the ability to bind efficiently human ACE2 (see EMBO J. 24:1634-1643(2005); PubMed: [15791205](http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15791205) ).

The severity of the 2002-2003 epidemic was presumably due to those two amino-acid mutations, giving opportunity to an animal virus to cause a major infection in the human species.
