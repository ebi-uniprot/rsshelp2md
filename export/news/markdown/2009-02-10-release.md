### The UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot bronze medal is awarded to the plant Arabidopsis thaliana

With [7'764 manually annotated entries](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy:3702+AND+reviewed:yes) , [*Arabidopsis thaliana*](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/3702) is now the third most represented species in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, behind [*Homo sapiens* (human)](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy:9606+AND+reviewed:yes) and [*Mus musculus* (mouse)](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy:10090+AND+reviewed:yes) . This corresponds to about 25% of the [complete proteome](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy:3702+AND+keyword:181) of *A.thaliana* , which can be retrieved from UniProtKB using the keyword 'Complete proteome'.

The members of the [Plant Proteome Annotation Program (PPAP)](http://www.uniprot.org/program/Plants) are very proud of this third position. As shown in a study on Olympic medalists by [Medvec et al.](http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7473022) (1995), competitors who won the bronze medal are significantly happier with their award than those who won the silver medal. The silver medalists tend to be frustrated at having missed out on the gold, while the bronze medalists are simply happy to have received any honor at all.

## UniProtKB News

### Cross-references to Plant Ontology (PO) in the [tisslist.txt](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/tisslist) file

Cross-references to Plant Ontology (PO) have been added in the [tisslist.txt](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/tisslist) file. Each term in this tissue list can be mapped to the corresponding eVOC term and, as of this release, also to a [Plant Ontology (PO)](http://www.plantontology.org/) term.

Examples:

    ID   Aleurone.
    AC   TS-0027
    SY   Aleurone layer.
    DR   PO; PO:0005360; aleurone layer.
    //
    ID   Embryo.
    AC   TS-0229
    SY   Embryonic; Embryonic tissue; Whole embryo; Parthenogenote.
    DR   eVOC; EV:0300001; development-stage: embryo.
    DR   PO; PO:0009009; embryo.
    //

### Cross-references to IPI

Cross-references have been added to the International Protein Index [IPI](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/IPI/IPIhelp.html) . IPI maintains a database of cross-references between the primary data sources, provides minimally redundant yet maximally complete sets of proteins and maintains stable identifiers for proteomes of higher eukaryotic organisms.

IPI is available at <http://www.ebi.ac.uk/IPI/IPIhelp.html> .

The format of the explicit links in the flat file is:

<table><colgroup><col style="width: 50%" /><col style="width: 50%" /></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Resource abbreviation</td><td>IPI</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Resource identifier</td><td>IPI unique identifier.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Examples</td><td><pre><code>Q8NFR9:

### Cross-references to Bgee

Cross-references have been added to [Bgee](http://bgee.unil.ch/bgee/bgee) , a database for Gene Expression Evolution. Bgee is a database that allows to retrieve and compare gene expression patterns between animal species. Bgee first maps heterogeneous expression data (currently EST, Affymetrix and *in situ* hybridization data) on anatomical and developmental ontologies.

Bgee is available at <http://bgee.unil.ch/bgee/bgee> .

The format of the explicit links in the flat file is:

<table><colgroup><col style="width: 50%" /><col style="width: 50%" /></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Resource abbreviation</td><td>Bgee</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Resource identifier</td><td>UniProtKB accession number.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Examples</td><td><pre><code>Q9Z351:
