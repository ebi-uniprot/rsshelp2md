### Changes concerning the [controlled vocabulary for PTMs](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/ptmlist)

We are continuously overhauling the annotation of post-translational modifications (PTMs). For the feature key [MOD\_RES](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/mod_res) , the new introduced controlled vocabularies for PTMs are:

-   Flavin binding: All entries with annotated flavin-binding sites have the keyword [Flavoprotein](http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-0285) .

         FMN phosphoryl serine (Keyword: FMN)
         FMN phosphoryl threonine (Keyword: FMN)
         O-8alpha-FAD tyrosine (Keyword: FAD)
         S-4a-FMN cysteine (Keyword: FMN)
         S-6-FMN cysteine (Keyword: FMN)
         S-8alpha-FAD cysteine (Keyword: FAD)
         Tele-8alpha-FAD histidine (Keyword: FAD)
         Tele-8alpha-FMN histidine (Keyword: FMN)

-   Hydroxylation: All entries with annotated hydroxylation sites have the keyword [Hydroxylation](http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-0379) .

         4,5-dihydroxylysine
         3,4-dihydroxyproline

-   Other new controlled vocabularies for PTMs that are annotated with the feature key MOD\_RES:

         O-(sn-1-glycerophosphoryl)serine
