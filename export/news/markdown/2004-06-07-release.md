### Fungi and Swiss-Prot

As we are reaching the 10'000 entries mark for fungi in Swiss-Prot, we believe it is useful to inform our users that we are actively working in speeding up the annotation and re-annotation of fungal protein sequences and most notably those originating from the two model organisms [*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/4932) and [*Schizosaccharomyces pombe*](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/4896) . We are currently building up a fungal annotation group which will soon consist of four annotators, three in Geneva and one in Hinxton.

## UniProt news

### Changes concerning keywords

New keywords:

-   [Direct protein sequencing](http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-0903)
-   [Nuclear pore complex](http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-0906)

  

### Changes concerning the [controlled vocabulary for PTMs](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/ptmlist)

We are continuously overhauling the annotation of post-translational modifications (PTMs). For the feature key [MOD\_RES](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/mod_res) , the new initially introduced controlled vocabularies for PTMs are:

-   Bromination: All entries with annotated bromination sites have the keyword [Bromination](http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-0102) .

         Bromohistidine
         6'-bromotryptophan

-   Deamidation

         Deamidated asparagine
         Deamidated glutamine

-   Formylation: All entries with annotated formylation sites have the keyword [Formylation](http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-0291) .

         N-formylmethionine
         N-formylglycine

-   Hydroxylation: All entries with annotated hydroxylation sites have the keyword [Hydroxylation](http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-0379) .

         Hydroxyproline
         3-hydroxyasparagine
         3-hydroxyaspartate
         5-hydroxylysine
         3-hydroxytryptophan

-   Iodination: All entries with annotated iodination sites have the keyword [Iodination](http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-0405) .

         Thyroxine
         Triiodothyronine

-   Other new controlled vocabularies for PTMs that are annotated with the feature key MOD\_RES:

         3',4'-dihydroxyphenylalanine
         3-methylthioaspartic acid
         3-oxoalanine (Cys)
         3-oxoalanine (Ser)
         4-carboxyglutamate (Keyword: Gamma-carboxyglutamic acid)
         ADP-ribosylarginine
         ADP-ribosylcysteine
         Allysine
         Aspartyl isopeptide (Asn)
         Cysteine persulfide
         Pentaglycyl murein peptidoglycan amidated threonine
         PolyADP-ribosyl glutamic acid
         Pyruvic acid (Ser)
         Pyruvic acid (Cys)
