## Swiss-Prot release 42.6 of 28-Nov-2003

### New comment line (CC) topic RNA EDITING

We have introduced a new comment (CC) line topic: 'RNA EDITING'. This topic is used to convey information relevant to all types of RNA editing that lead to one or more amino acid changes.

The format of this comment block is:

    CC   -!- RNA EDITING: Modified_positions={x[, y, z, ...] | Not_applicable | Undetermined}[; Note=Text].

Examples:

    CC   -!- RNA EDITING: Modified_positions=393, 431, 452, 495.

    CC   -!- RNA EDITING: Modified_positions=59, 78, 94, 98, 102, 121; Note=The
    CC       stop codon at position 121 is created by RNA editing. The nonsense
    CC       codon at position 59 is modified to a sense codon.

    CC   -!- RNA EDITING: Modified_positions=Not_applicable; Note=Some
    CC       positions are modified by RNA editing via nucleotide insertion or
    CC       deletion. The initiator methionine is created by RNA editing.

The free text in the 'Note' is standardized.

All entries with such a topic have the keyword [RNA editing](http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-0691) .

### Changes concerning keywords

New keyword:

-   [Sodium channel](http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-0894)

## Swiss-Prot release 42.5 of 21-Nov-2003

### Headlines: Monkey business!

The comparison of the genome of human with that of higher apes such as chimpanzees, gibbons, gorillas and the orangutans, was for a long time a wish of many life scientists.

It is becoming a reality due to various sequencing initiatives targeted toward the elucidation of primate genomic sequences. However it will take some time before a significant amount of high quality complete protein sequences are available. In the meanwhile we are trying to ensure that whenever an existing higher ape sequence is available that correspond to a cognate human protein, that sequence gets annotated very quickly.

For example, in the last two weeks, the number of annotated chimpanzees protein sequences in Swiss-Prot has doubled.

## Swiss-Prot release 42.4 of 14-Nov-2003

### Content changes in the speclist.txt document file

The [speclist.txt](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/speclist) file lists the organism identification codes which are used to build the "organism" part of an entry name (Examples: ARATH, BACSU, DROME, HUMAN, etc). This file contains for each organism code, the corresponding NCBI taxonomic database node identifier (TaxID) as well as the specific official (scientific) name and optionally common name and synonym.

Up to now organisms identification codes where only used in Swiss-Prot where all species represented in the database are associated with such a code. The TrEMBL section of the combined UniProt knowledgebase will soon also make use of entry names that are based on the species of origin. As it is not possible in a reasonable time frame to manually assign organism codes to all species represented in TrEMBL, it was decided to define "virtual" codes that regroup organisms at a certain taxonomic level. Such codes are prefixed by the number "9" and generally correspond to a "pool" of organisms which can be 'wide' as a kingdom. Here are some examples of such codes:

    9BACT B      2: N=Bacteria
    9CNID E   6073: N=Cnidaria
    9FUNG E   4751: N=Fungi
    9REOV V  10880: N=Reoviridae
    9TETR E  32523: N=Tetrapoda
    9VIRI E  33090: N=Viridiplantae

The list of all the "9" codes that have been defined are now been integrated as a subsection of the speclist.txt file.

### Changes concerning the [controlled vocabulary for PTMs](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/ptmlist)

New terms for the Feature key 'LIPID':

-   GPI-anchor amidated residue
-   Omega-hydroxyceramide glutamate ester
-   Phosphatidylethanolamine amidated glycine

### Changes concerning keywords

New keyword:

-   [Thyroid hormones biosynthesis](http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-0893)

## Swiss-Prot release 42.3 of 07-Nov-2003

### Headlines: More than 10'000 human proteins have been annotated

In the framework of the [HPI](http://www.expasy.org/sprot/hpi/) project, we have annotated more than 10'000 proteins (almost 10'300). The exact number of genes represented is not exactly equal to the number of proteins for at least four reasons:

-   We have entries that describe proteins encoded by more than one gene but whose amino acid sequences are 100% identical;
-   We sometimes are unable to describe highly divergent splice isoforms in one entry and these genes are therefore represented by two or more Swiss-Prot entries;
-   For MHC histocompatibility antigens, immunoglobulin and T cell receptors, we often have several entries representing groups of alleles;
-   A very small number of human entries probably represent "bogus" proteins originating from either pseudogenes or from contaminants.

But even taking the above factors into account, we do have more than 10'000 protein-encoding genes represented in Swiss-Prot.

### Cross-references to DictyBase

We have added cross-references to the DictyBase database (available at <http://dictybase.org/> ), an online informatics resource for Dictyostelium discoideum. DictyBase goals are to provide a single portal for access to Dictyostelium genome information, curated Dictyostelium literature, to facilitate access to experimental resources such as the Dictyostelium stock center, and to provide an on-line presence for the Dictyostelium community.

The identifiers of the appropriate DR line are:

<table><colgroup><col style="width: 44%" /><col style="width: 55%" /></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Resource abbreviation</td><td>DictyBase</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Resource identifier</td><td>DictyBase's unique identifier for a gene.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Optional information 1</td><td>DictyBase's gene symbol.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Example</td><td><pre><code>P34092:
DR   DictyBase; DDB0002013; myoB.</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Cross-refereces to DictyDb

Due to the availability of DictyBase (see above) and in agreement with the maintainers of both databases, we have removed all cross-references to the DictyDb database.

### Cross-refereces to PhotoList

We have added cross-references to the PhotoList database (available at <http://genolist.pasteur.fr/PhotoList/> ), a database dedicated to the analysis of the genome of Photorhabdus luminescens strain TT01.

The identifiers of the appropriate DR line are:

<table><colgroup><col style="width: 44%" /><col style="width: 55%" /></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Resource abbreviation</td><td>PhotoList</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Resource identifier</td><td>PhotoList's unique identifier for an ORF.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Example</td><td><pre><code>Q8KM01:

### Case and wording change for submissions to Swiss-Prot in reference location (RL) lines

While proceeding with the conversion to mixed case of the different line types of a Swiss-Prot entry, we have decided to do the same for the name of our database, e.g.Â we are now using "Swiss-Prot" (instead of previously "SWISS-PROT") as the prevalent way of referring to it. This change affects the Swiss-Prot RL (reference location) lines of entries which were submitted directly to Swiss-Prot, and which the authors have not (yet) published. At the same time, we have changed the wording of those lines.

Former format:

    RL   Submitted (MAY-2002) to the SWISS-PROT data bank.

New format:

    RL   Submitted (MAY-2002) to Swiss-Prot.

Note: RL lines concerning submissions to EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ, PDB and other databases are not affected by this modification.

### New comment line (CC) topic ALLERGEN

We have introduced a new comment (CC) line topic type: ALLERGEN. This topic is used to convey information relevant to allergenic proteins.

The format of this comment block is:

    CC   -!- ALLERGEN: Text.

Examples:

     P19121:
    CC   -!- ALLERGEN: Causes an allergic reaction in human. Binds IgE. It is a
    CC       partially heat-labile allergen that may cause both respiratory and
    CC       food-allergy symptoms in patients with the bird-egg syndrome.

     Q28050:
    CC   -!- ALLERGEN: Causes an allergic reaction in human. Minor allergen of
    CC       bovine dander.

### Headlines: Annotation of microbial H(+)-translocating pyrophosphatases

We have annotated the microbial H(+)-translocating pyrophosphatases present in the acidocalcisome, the first eukaryotic organelle to be found in bacteria.

Acidocalcisomes are organelles that have an acidic nature, high eletronic density and contain high concentrations of calcium, magnesium, pyrophosphate and polyP. They were originally found in unicellular eukaryotes, such as Toxoplasma gondii and trypanosomatids. It has been postulated that acidocalcisomes may have an important role as an energy source and in the regulation of intracellualr pH, calcium concentration and osmotic conditions.

Now the group of Roberto Docampo has found them in the bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens. This is the first organelle to be found in bacteria that have a direct counterpart in eukaryotes. The typical characteristic of the acidocalcisome is the presence of a number of pumps and exchangers: one of them is the H(+)-translocating pyrophosphatase (H+-PPase). This pump generates a proton motive force and may be responsible for the synthesis of pyrophosphate. They are found in several bacteria and archaea and at present it is unkown whether any of these is also localized in acidocalcisomes. As these pumps are present only in some pathogenic bacteria but not in humans, drugs that target them might be effective against these infections.

### Changes concerning keywords

Modified keyword:

-   **Metachromatic leucodystrophy** was renamed to [Metachromatic leukodystrophy](http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-0478)

## Swiss-Prot release 41.17 of 19-Jul-2003

### Cross-references to GermOnline

We have added cross-references to the GermOnline database (available at [http://germonline.unibas.org/](http://germonline.unibas.ch/) ), which is maintained by the [Genome Bioinformatics group](http://www.isb-sib.ch/groups/genombio.htm) of the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. GermOnline is a gateway for gametogenesis. Its goals are to provide a rapid access to a comprehensive compilation of genes, expression data and functions implicated in germline development, meiosis, gamete formation, and gamete function in 11 key model systems and H. sapiens. At this time, the majority of cross-references in Swiss-Prot concern Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene expression data.

The identifiers of the appropriate DR line are:

<table><colgroup><col style="width: 48%" /><col style="width: 52%" /></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Resource abbreviation</td><td>GermOnline</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Resource identifier</td><td>GermOnline's identifier for a gene.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Example</td><td><pre><code>P58012:

### Headlines: Complete update of PDB cross-references

We have completely updated our cross-references to PDB. Thanks to work done by the EBI and Geneva Swiss-Prot groups in collaboration with the EBI MSD (Macromolecular Structure Database) group we have mapped at the atom level PDB structural data to the relevant Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL entries. This work has led to the introduction of cross-references to PDB in TrEMBL and a very significant increase in the number of these cross-references in Swiss-Prot. More than 6'000 cross-references were added and the number of Swiss-Prot entries that are linked to PDB is now above 5'300 (versus about 3'600 before this work was carried out).

### New syntax of the CC line topic ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS

In Swiss-Prot release 41.1 (and in the accompanying TrEMBL release), a new format was introduced for "CC ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS" lines. The new format is more structured than the previous format. Associated with these changes are the introduction of stable identifiers for each named splice isoform in all entries that describe more than one splice isoform; the extension of feature identifiers, previously only used for human VARIANT and certain CARBOHYD features, to VARSPLIC features in entries from all species.

The new format of the CC line topic ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS is:

    CC   -!- ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS:
    CC       Event=Alternative promoter;
    CC         Comment=Free text;
    CC       Event=Alternative splicing; Named isoforms=n;
    CC         Comment=Optional free text;
    CC       Name=Isoform_1; Synonyms=Synonym_1[, Synonym_n];
    CC         IsoId=Isoform_identifier_1[, Isoform_identifer_n];
    CC         Sequence=Displayed;
    CC         Note=Free text;
    CC       Name=Isoform_n; Synonyms=Synonym_1[, Synonym_n];
    CC         IsoId=Isoform_identifier_1[, Isoform_identifer_n];
    CC         Sequence=VSP_identifier_1 [, VSP_identifier_n];
    CC         Note=Free text;

## Swiss-Prot release 41.0, 28-Feb-2003

### Progress in the conversion of Swiss-Prot to mixed-case characters

We are gradually converting Swiss-Prot entries from all UPPER CASE to MiXeD CaSe. With this release the RC (Reference Comment) line topic STRAIN and the CC line topic CATALYTIC ACTIVITY have been converted.

### "Nucleomorph" added to the OrGanelle (OG) line

The OG (OrGanelle) line indicates from which genome a gene for a protein originates. Until now, defined terms in the OG line where "Chloroplast", "Cyanelle", "Mitochondrion" and "Plasmid". The term "Nucleomorph" has been added, which is the residual nucleus of an algal endosymbiont that resides inside its host cell.

### Multiple RP lines

Starting with release 41, there can be more than one RP (Reference Position) line per reference in a Swiss-Prot entry. The RP line describes the extent of the work carried out by the authors of the reference, e.g.Â the type of molecule that has been sequenced, protein characterization, PTM characterization, protein structure analysis, variation detection, etc.

As the number of experimental results per publication has increased over the years, the limitation of using a single RP line per reference no longer allowed to add all the information while maintaining a consistent format. Therefore we decided to permit multiple RP lines.

Example:

    RP   SEQUENCE FROM N.A., SEQUENCE OF 23-42 AND 351-365, AND
    RP   CHARACTERIZATION.

### Cross-references to Schizosaccharomyces pombe GeneDB Prototype

We have added cross-references to the Schizosaccharomyces pombe GeneDB Prototype (available at <http://www.genedb.org/genedb/pombe/index.jsp> ), which contains all S. pombe known and predicted protein coding genes, pseudogenes and tRNAs. It is hosted by the Sanger Institute.

The identifiers of the appropriate DR line are:

<table><colgroup><col style="width: 41%" /><col style="width: 58%" /></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Resource abbreviation</td><td>GeneDB_SPombe</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Resource identifier</td><td>GeneDB's unique identifier for a S. pombe gene.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Example</td><td><pre><code>DR   GeneDB_SPombe; SPAC9E9.12c; -.</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Cross-referecences to Genew

We have added cross-references to the Human Gene Nomenclature Database Genew (available at <http://www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/nomenclature/searchgenes.pl> ), which provides data for all human genes which have approved symbols. It is managed by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC).

The identifiers of the appropriate DR line are:

<table><colgroup><col style="width: 44%" /><col style="width: 55%" /></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Resource abbreviation</td><td>Genew</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Resource identifier</td><td>HGNC's unique identifier for a human gene</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Optional information 1</td><td>HGNC's approved gene symbol.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Example</td><td><pre><code>DR   Genew; HGNC:5217; HSD3B1.</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Cross-references to Gramene

We have added cross-references to the Gramene database, a comparative mapping resource for grains (available at <http://www.gramene.org/> ).

The format of the explicit links in the flat file is:

<table><colgroup><col style="width: 25%" /><col style="width: 74%" /></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Resource abbreviation</td><td>Gramene</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Resource identifier</td><td>Unique identifier for a protein, which is identical to the Swiss-Prot primary AC number of that protein.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Example</td><td><pre><code>DR   Gramene; Q06967; -.</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Cross-references to HAMAP

We have added cross-references to the collection of orthologous microbial protein families, generated manually by expert curators of the HAMAP (High-quality Automated and Manual Annotation of microbial Proteomes) project in the framework of the Swiss-Prot protein knowledgebase. The data is accessible at [/sprot/hamap/families.html](http://www.expasy.org/sprot/hamap/families.html) .

The identifiers of the appropriate DR line are:

<table><colgroup><col style="width: 7%" /><col style="width: 92%" /></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Resource abbreviation</td><td>HAMAP</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Resource identifier</td><td>HAMAP unique identifier for a microbe protein family</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Optional information 1</td><td>The values are either '-', 'fused', 'atypical' or 'atypical/fused'. The value '-' is a placeholder for an empty field; the 'fused' value indicates that the family rule does not cover the entire protein; the value 'atypical' points out that the protein is divergent in sequence or has mutated functional sites, and should not be included in family datasets. The value 'atypical/fused' indicates both latter findings.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Optional information 2</td><td>Number of domains found in the protein, generally '1', rarely '2' for the fusion of 2 identical domains.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Example</td><td><pre><code>DR   HAMAP; MF_00012; -; 1.</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Cross-references to Phosphorylation Site Database

We have added cross-references to the Phosphorylation Site Database, PhosSite (available at <http://vigen.biochem.vt.edu/xpd/xpd.htm> ), which provides access to information from scientific literature concerning prokaryotic proteins that undergo covalent phosphorylation on the hydroxyl side chains of serine, threonine or tyrosine residues.

The identifiers of the appropriate DR line are:

<table><colgroup><col style="width: 24%" /><col style="width: 76%" /></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Resource abbreviation</td><td>PhosSite</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Resource identifier</td><td>Unique identifier for a phosphoprotein, which is identical to the Swiss-Prot primary AC number of that protein.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Example</td><td><pre><code>DR   PhosSite; P00955; -.</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Cross-references to TIGRFAMs

We have added cross-references to TIGRFAMs, a protein family database available at <http://www.tigr.org/TIGRFAMs/> .

The identifiers of the appropriate DR line are:

<table><colgroup><col style="width: 40%" /><col style="width: 59%" /></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Resource abbreviation</td><td>TIGRFAMs</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Resource identifier</td><td>TIGRFAMs' unique identifier for a protein family.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Optional information 1</td><td>TIGRFAMs' entry name for a protein family.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Optional information 2</td><td>Number of hits found in the sequence.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>Example</td><td><pre><code>DR   TIGRFAMs; TIGR00630; uvra; 1.</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Cross-references to CarbBank

We have removed the Swiss-Prot cross-references to CarbBank.

### Cross-references to GCRDb

We have removed the Swiss-Prot cross-references to GCRDb.

### Cross-references to Mendel

We have removed the Swiss-Prot cross-references to Mendel.

### Cross-references to YEPD

We have removed the Swiss-Prot cross-references to the yeast electrophoresis protein database (YEPD).

### Explicit links to dbSNP in FT VARIANT lines of human sequence entries

In human protein sequence entries we have introduced explicit links to the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database ( [dbSNP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/) ) from the feature description of FT VARIANT keys.

The format of such links is:

    FT   VARIANT    from     to   description (IN dbSNP:accession_number).
    FT                                /FTId=VAR_number.

Example:

    FT   VARIANT      65     65       T -> I (IN dbSNP:1065419).
    FT                                /FTId=VAR_012009.

### Feature key SIMILAR became obsolete

The feature key SIMILAR was used to describe the extent of a similarity with another protein sequence. Nowadays, most domains with similarity to other proteins are known regions described in domain and family databases, which are annotated in Swiss-Prot with the feature key DOMAIN or REPEAT and the comment (CC) line topic SIMILARITY; thus the feature key SIMILAR became obsolete and will not be used again.

### Version of SP in XML format

A distribution version of Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL in XML format is being developed. The first draft of the XML specification was released for public review on February 21, 2002.
