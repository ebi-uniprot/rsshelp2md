### Complete set of Arabidopsis thaliana F-box proteins

F-box proteins play a major role in the ubiquitin conjugation pathway. There are involved in the third step of this pathway. Most of the F-box protein contains a conserved [F-box domain](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/IEntry?ac=IPR001810) near the N-terminus and a variable region. The F-box domain can interact with Cullin and one of the SKP1 proteins to form a **E3 SCF (SKP1/Cullin/F-box) ubiquitin ligase complex** . The variable region interacts with a specific protein, which is, in turn, ubiquitinated and thus targeted to protein degradation. This variable region confers the specificity of the SCF complex.

**The whole set of *Arabidopsis thaliana*** , more than [630 F-box protein sequences](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=domain:%22f+box%22+AND+organism:%22arabidopsis+thaliana%22+AND+reviewed:yes) , has been **manually reviewed and integrated into UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot** . About 120 wrong gene model predictions have been corrected, including 26 F-box proteins obtained by splitting erroneous gene predictions covering more than one gene. This represents one of the largest protein family of a given species that had ever been integrated into UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.

In *A. thaliana* , **almost half of F-box proteins contains a combination of different domains** which is used to define subgroups:

Among this large protein family, less than 30 members have been characterized: their functions are various and include flowering, circadian cycle, hormone signaling, and plant defense.
