### A UniProtKB major release (15.0)

UniProt Knowledgebase release 15.0 includes Swiss-Prot release 57.0 and TrEMBL release 40.0.

Release 57.0 of 24-Mar-09 of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot contains 428'650 sequence entries, comprising 154'416'236 amino acids abstracted from 177'584 references. 36'053 sequences have been added since release 56.0, the sequence data of 2'010 existing entries have been manually updated and the annotations of 368'500 entries have been revised.

Release 40.0 of 24-Mar-2009 of UniProtKB/TrEMBL contains 7'537'442 sequence entries, comprising 2'459'135'421 amino acids. 1'700'878 sequences have been added since release 39.0, the sequence data of 24'829 existing entries has been updated and the annotations of 4'218'268 entries have been revised. This represents an increase of 31%.

The following improvements were carried out in the last 8 months:

-   We have structured the 'Pathway' subsection of the 'General annotation (Comments)' section (comment line (CC) topic PATHWAY in the flat file), using the controlled vocabulary provided by the [UniPathway](http://www.grenoble.prabi.fr/obiwarehouse/unipathway) resource, in order to improve the consistency of annotation and to allow to parse its content. To accompany this change, we have created a new document: [pathlist.txt](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/pathlist) which describes the controlled vocabulary used in the 'Pathway' subsection of the 'General annotation (Comments)' section.
-   We have enriched the controlled vocabulary for subcellular location description with 14 new terms. 6 have been deleted.
-   We have enriched the controlled vocabulary for post-translational modification description with 30 new terms: 9 for the subsection 'Modified residue' of the 'Sequence annotation (Features)' section (FT 'MOD\_RES' in the flat file) and 21 for the subsection 'Cross-link' (FT 'CROSSLNK' in the flat file).
-   We have added cross-references to 9 new databases, bringing the total number of explicit cross-references to 111: [Bgee](http://bgee.unil.ch/bgee/bgee) , [GeneCards](http://www.genecards.org/) , [IPI](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/IPI/IPIhelp.html) , [NextBio](http://www.nextbio.com/) , [Pathway\_Interaction\_DB](http://pid.nci.nih.gov/) , [PRIDE](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride//) , [TCDB](http://www.tcdb.org/) , [Xenbase](http://www.xenbase.org/) and to [Plant Ontology (PO)](http://www.plantontology.org/) in the [tisslist.txt](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/tisslist) file. Cross-references to StyGene have been removed.
-   We have added 17 new keywords and 1 has been deleted. 10 of the newly created keywords are medical ones.

## UniProtKB News

### Change in the 'Encoded on' subsection (OG line in the flat file): from 'Chromatophore' to 'Organellar chromatophore'

After discussion with experts in the field and consultation with the Gene Ontology experts we have changed the OG line describing proteins encoded by the chromatophore of *Paulinella chromatophora* from:

          OG   Plastid; Chromatophore.
         

to:

          OG   Plastid; Organellar chromatophore.
         

### Changes concerning cross-references to StyGene

Cross-references to StyGene have been removed.

### Removal of the 'salty.txt' document

The document **salty.txt** , listing *Salmonella typhimurium* strain LT2 entries, gene names and cross-references to StyGene, has been removed.

### Changes concerning keywords

New keywords:

-   [Atrial fibrillation](http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-1015)
