       1.2  Source of data

       Release 13.0  has been  updated using protein sequence data from release
       22.0 of  the PIR (Protein Identification Resource) protein data bank, as
       well as translation of nucleotide sequence data from release 21.0 of the
       EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Data Library.

       data bank  we list  here the  statistics  concerning  the  DR  (Databank
       Reference) pointer lines:

       2.2  New line-type

       Release 12  introduced a  new type  of data  line, the  OG line.  The OG
       (OrGanelle) lines  indicate  whether  the  gene  coding  for  a  protein
       originates from  the mitochondria,  the chloroplast,  or a  plasmid. The
       format for the OG line is:

       OG   CHLOROPLAST.
       OG   MITOCHONDRION.
       OG   PLASMID name.

       Where 'name' is the name of the plasmid.

       Previously this  information was  stored in the OS line, as shown in the
       example below.

       OS   WHEAT (TRITICUM AESTIVUM) CHLOROPLAST.

       The above example is now stored as:

       OS   WHEAT (TRITICUM AESTIVUM).
       OG   CHLOROPLAST.


       2.3  New topic for the comments (CC) line type

       As of release 12 we have added a new 'topic' for the comments (CC) line-
       type: CAUTION.  It is  used to  indicate  that  possible  errors  and/or
       grounds for confusion may exist. Example of its usage:

       CC   -!- CAUTION: ALSO SEE VERSION 2 OF THIS PROTEIN THAT DIFFERS DUE
       CC       TO A FRAMESHIFT.


       2.4  Small change in the RL lines for submissions

       RL lines  for data  submitted to  EMBL or Genbank was represented by two
       subtypes of RL lines, as illustrated in the following examples:

       RL   SUBMITTED (OCT-1989) TO THE EMBL DATA LIBRARY.
       RL   SUBMITTED (OCT-1989) TO GENBANK.

       Starting with  release 13,  all these  lines are  now in  the  following
       format:

       RL   SUBMITTED (OCT-1989) TO EMBL/GENBANK DATA BANKS.


       2.5  Documentation changes

       -  ACINDEX.TXT is  a new  document file  which is  an index  of all  the
          accession numbers  which appear  in SWISS-PROT  and the  name of  the
          entries in which they occur.
       -  PDBTOSP.TXT is  a new  document file  which is  an index  of all  the
          Brookhaven PDB entries referenced in SWISS-PROT.
       -  The JOURLIST.TXT document now indicates the abbreviation and the full
          names of all journals cited in SWISS-PROT.

       Important: for  more  detailed  information  concerning  the  SWISS-PROT
       documentation please consult appendix C of these release notes.



         3. IMPORTANT NOTES CONCERNING SWISS-PROT RELEASE 13 AND PC/GENE 6.01

       3.1  The ryanodine receptor

       The rabbit  skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYNR$RABIT) is a protein
       of 5037  amino acid  residues. PC/Gene  release 6.01  can  only  analyze
       proteins of  up to  5000 residues.  This limitation will be increased in
       the next  major version  (6.50). Until  this release  we have dealt with
       this protein  in the  following way:  the sequence  entry RYNR$RABIT was
       split into two parts. RYN1$RABIT contains the first 4563 residues (which
       corresponds to the cytoplasmic domain), and RYN2$RABIT contains residues
       4561 to 5037.

       Note: due  to this  modification there are 13838 sequence entries in the
       PC/Gene version  of the SWISS-PROT data bank (instead of 13837 as listed
       in section 1.1 of these release notes).

       3.2  The OG line

       The OG  line-type introduced  in release  12 (see  section 2.2)  is  not
       supported by  release 6.01  of PC/Gene.  This means  that although these
       lines are present in the SWISS-PROT data base (either on the CD-ROM disk
       or on the bulk files on the floppy disks), you can not make use of them.
       Release 6.50 will fully support OG lines.


       Note to  CD-ROM users:  library files  containing the  names of  all the
       sequences  which   originate  from   either  the   mitochondria  or  the
       chloroplast are available on the CD-ROM (for more details see the CD-ROM
       release notes).



                                4. WE NEED YOUR HELP !

       We welcome  feedback from our users. We would especially appreciate that
       you notify  us if  you find  that sequences  belonging to  your field of
       expertise are  missing from  the data  bank. We  also would  like to  be
       notified about annotations to be updated, as for example if the function
       of a protein has been clarified or if new post-translational information
       has become available.

       C.2  IBM PS/2 1.4 Mb disks

       The number  and content  of the  1.4 Mb  disks for  the PS/2 systems are
       exactly identical to those of the 1.2 Mb disks (see above).

       C.3  Catalog file

       The SWISS-PROT  catalog file for PC/Gene (PROT_CAT.TXT) is stored on two
       disks (CATALOG  disks 1  and 2).  Insert the  first disk  in your floppy
       drive and  type: INSCAT.  Follow the  program instructions,  you will be
       prompted to enter the second disk once the content of the first one have
       been copied.

       C.4  Documentation disks

       There are  two documentation  disks. The  content of  these two disks is
       described in appendix B.
