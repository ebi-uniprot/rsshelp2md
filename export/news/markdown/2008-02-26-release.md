### UniProtKB major release (13.0)

UniProt Knowledgebase release 13.0 includes Swiss-Prot release 55.0 and TrEMBL release 38.0.

Release 55.0 of 26-Feb-08 of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot contains 356'194 sequence entries, comprising 127'836'513 amino acids abstracted from 165776 references. 80'183 sequences have been added since release 54.0, the sequence data of 1'411 existing entries has been updated and the annotations of 262'009 entries have been revised.

The following improvements were carried out in the last 7 months:

-   We have changed the representation of non-standard amino acids (selenocysteine and pyrrolysine). They are now annotated under a new feature key 'Non- standard residue' ('NON\_STD' in the flat file), and are represented in the sequence using the IUPAC/IUBMB recommended one-letter codes 'U' for selenocysteine and 'O' for pyrrolysine.
-   We have structured the 'Subcellular location' subsection in the 'General annotation' section (CC line, topic SUBCELLULAR LOCATION in the flat file) in order to improve the consistency of annotation and to allow to parse its content.
-   To be consistent with other comment line topics, we have applied small changes to the topics WEB RESOURCE and MASS SPECTROMETRY.
-   We have enriched the controlled vocabulary for post-translational modification description with 14 new terms for the feature key 'MOD\_RES'.
-   We have added cross-references to 8 new databases: [2DBase-Ecoli](http://2dbase.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de) , [CleanEx](http://www.cleanex.isb-sib.ch/) , [GeneID](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=gene) , [PDBsum](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbsum) , [PhosphoSite](http://phosphosite.cellsignal.com) , [RefSeq](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/) , [VectorBase](http://www.vectorbase.org/) , and [World-2DPAGE](http://world-2dpage.expasy.org/) .
-   We have added 9 new keywords, 3 have been modified and 1 deleted.
-   We have added 11 new documents:
    -   [Human and mouse protein kinases: classification and index](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/pkinfam)
    -   [Controlled vocabulary of subcellular locations and membrane topologies and orientations](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/subcell)
    -   [Brucella abortus strain 2308: entries and gene names](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/brua2)
    -   [bruab.txtBrucella abortus: entries and gene names](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/bruab)
    -   [Brucella melitensis: entries and gene names](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/brume)
    -   [Brucella suis: entries and gene names](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/brusu)
    -   [Coxiella burnetii: entries and gene names](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/coxbu)
    -   [Rickettsia bellii strain RML369-C: entries and gene names](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/ricbr)
    -   [Rickettsia conorii: entries and gene names](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/riccn)
    -   [Rickettsia felis (Rickettsia azadi): entries and gene names](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/ricfe)
    -   [Rickettsia typhi: entries and gene names](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/ricty)
-   We have created a non-redundant set of Arabidopsis proteins, including nuclear, mitochondrial and chloroplastic proteins, and the selected entries have been labelled with the keyword 'Complete proteome' to allow easy retrieval.
-   We have begun the procedure to integrate automatically entries annotated by the HAMAP automated pipeline. In this pipeline, proteins from complete bacterial and archaeal proteomes, together with the related plastid proteins, are automatically annotated based on manually created family rules for complete protein annotation, with template-based feature propagation. We have established many checks and conditional propagation in order to ensure that automatic annotation will produce data of a quality up to that of manual curation.

## UniProtKB News

### New representation of non-standard amino acids (selenocysteine and pyrrolysine)

The non-standard amino acids selenocysteine and pyrrolysine used to be annotated in the 'Sequence annotation' section, 'Amino acid modifications' subsection, under the feature keys 'Selenocysteine' and 'Modified residue', respectively. In the sequence, selenocysteine was represented by the one-letter code 'C' and pyrrolysine by 'K'. In order to annotate these and future non-standard amino acids more adequately, we created a new key 'Non- standard residue'. The type of non-standard residue involved is indicated in the 'description' of the feature key. Sequences will accomodate the IUPAC/IUBMB recommended one-letter codes 'U' for selenocysteine and 'O' for pyrrolysine.

In the flat file, selenocysteine used to be described with the feature key SE\_CYS and pyrrolysine with the more generic feature key MOD\_RES. We have replaced these keys with the new feature key NON\_STD (non-standard). The type of non-standard residue involved is indicated in the 'description' of the NON\_STD key.
