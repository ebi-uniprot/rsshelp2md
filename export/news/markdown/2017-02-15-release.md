## Headline

### Freshwater fish see red

Vision relies on specialized neurons found in the retina, called photoreceptor cells. Vertebrate photoreceptor cells contain visual pigments consisting of a G-protein-coupled receptor, called opsin, and a covalently bound chromophore derived from vitamin A, most commonly [11-cis retinal](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:16066) (a derivative of vitamin A1). Light-induced isomerization of 11-cis retinal to [all-trans](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:17898) triggers a conformational change leading to G-protein activation, release of all-trans retinal and activation of the phototransduction cascade.

Typical rod photopigments have a maximum light absorbance of around 500 nm. However, at the end of the 19th century, [Köttgen and Abelsdorff](http://echo.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/ECHOdocuView?url=/permanent/vlp/lit36202/index.meta) observed that the rod pigments in certain freshwater fish were "red-shifted" towards 20-30 nm longer wavelengths than those of marine fish and terrestrial animals. This difference is due to a change in chromophore. Instead of 11-cis retinal, freshwater vertebrates use 11-cis 3,4-didehydroretinal, a derivative of vitamin A2, whose only difference with vitamin A1 is an additional conjugated double bond within its beta-ionone ring. What is the evolutionary advantage of this modification? Fresh water, in lakes or streams, is often murky. As a result, the light environment is shifted to the red and infrared end of the spectrum. Switching light absorbance seems to be the appropriate response to optimize vision in this specific aquatic milieu.

The chromophore switch is not only specific for certain species, it can also be regulated during life. For example, many amphibians use 11-cis 3,4-didehydroretinal during the tadpole stage, that they spend in ponds. Upon metamorphosis, they switch to 11-cis retinal which provides clear vision to the terrestrial adult they have become. Conversely, salmon live happily with 11-cis retinal in the open ocean. During spawning migration, however, 11-cis retinal is progressively replaced by 11-cis 3,4-didehydroretinal, possibly through the [action of thyroid hormones](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18552303) . In zebrafish also, the switch to vitamin A2-based chromophores can be induced by thyroid hormone treatment. Maybe the most striking example of differential usage of visual chromophores is provided by the American bullfrog. This voracious predator spends a large part of its life floating or swimming at the surface of the water, looking for aquatic, as well as aerial prey, with its eyes just above the waterline. Its dorsal retina, steered towards water, contains 11-cis 3,4-didehydroretinal, while its ventral retina uses 11-cis retinal.

While much of this knowledge on vitamins A1 and A2 was acquired long ago, the identity of the dehydrogenase catalyzing the switch between both forms remained elusive until December 2015, when [Enright et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26549260) published the identification of the enzyme. The authors compared the expression profile of zebrafish retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) of thyroid hormone-treated versus control animals. The most highly up-regulated transcript was that encoding cyp27c1, a cytochrome P450 family member. cyp27c1 was also strongly expressed in dorsal, but not ventral bullfrog RPE, correlating with the distribution of vitamin A2. In vitro, purified cyp27c1 was able to very efficiently catalyze the conversion of vitamin A1 to vitamin A2. In vivo, cyp27c1 knockout zebrafish survive to adulthood without overt developmental abnormalities. However, upon treatment with thyroid hormone, the mutant fish eyes fail to produce any vitamin A2 and their photoreceptors do not undergo a red-shift in sensitivity. Thus, the expression of a single enzyme, cyp27c1, mediates the dynamic spectral tuning of the entire visual system by controlling the balance of vitamin A1 and A2 in the eye.

Obviously, humans are not adapted for aquatic vision. However, they do produce vitamin A2, as has been documented in [keratinocytes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7803489) , and [they express CYP27C1 in liver, kidney and pancreas](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16360114) . The human enzyme [catalyzes the same reaction as fish and amphibian orthologs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27059013) , but the physiological relevance of this observation is not clear at present.

Zebrafish and bullfrog CYP27C1 entries have been annotated in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. The preliminary sequence of American bullfrog CYP27C1 was kindly provided by Professor Corbo and Dr. Enright and we would like to thank them sincerely. The human ortholog has been updated. All [3 entries](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=gene:cyp27c1+AND+%28organism:7955+OR+organism:8400+OR+organism:9606%29+AND+reviewed:yes) are publicly available as of this release.

### Removal of sequence similarity annotations for domains

[Sequence similarity](http://www.uniprot.org/help/sequence%5Fsimilarities) annotations were mainly used to describe two types of information:

1.  A family to which the protein belongs, worded as:  
    Belongs to *FamilyName* .
2.  A structural domain that the protein contains, worded as:  
    Contains *NumberOfOccurence* *DomainName* .

The domains that a protein contains are also annotated in 'Domain', 'Zinc finger', 'Repeat', 'Calcium binding' or 'DNA binding' annotations, which describe a domain's name and sequence coordinates. The 'Sequence similarity' annotations of type 2, however, described only a domain's name and number of occurences. We have therefore removed these less detailed annotations.
