## UniProtKB News

### Modified wording of reldate.txt in UniProt Knowledgebase ftp directories

The official names for the manually and automatically annotated sections of the UniProt Knowledgebase are **UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot** and **UniProtKB/TrEMBL** .

To reflect this, we have changed the wording of the reldate.txt file in UniProt Knowledgebase ftp directories:

from

    UniProt Release 5.4 consists of:
    Swiss-Prot Release 47.4 of 05-Jul-2005
    TrEMBL Release 30.4 of 05-Jul-2005

to

    UniProt Knowledgebase Release 5.4 consists of:
    UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Release 47.4 of 05-Jul-2005
    UniProtKB/TrEMBL Release 30.4 of 05-Jul-2005

### Format change in the dbxref.txt document file

The [dbxref.txt](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/dbxref) file lists the names and abbreviations and URLs of all databases cross-referenced in the UniProt Knowledgebase. We have added a new field, "Note", which is optional. This field will be used, among others, to list obsolete abbreviations for the cross-referenced databases.

Example:

    Abbrev: MGI
    Name  : Mouse genome database (MGD) from Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI)
    LinkTp: Explicit
    Server: http://www.informatics.jax.org/
    Db_URL: www.informatics.jax.org/searches/accession_report.cgi?id=%s
    Note  : Obsolete abbreviation: MGD

### Multiple comment line (CC) topics COFACTOR

From now on, the CC line topic COFACTOR can occur more than once per entry. When an enzyme can bind several cofactors, each of them is indicated in a separate topic.

Example:

    CC   -!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 2Fe-2S cluster per subunit (By similarity).
    CC   -!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 Fe(2+) ion per subunit (By similarity).

    CC   -!- COFACTOR: Binds 5 heme groups covalently per monomer.
    CC   -!- COFACTOR: Binds 1 calcium ion per monomer.
