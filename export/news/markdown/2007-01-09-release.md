### Complete yeast proteome in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot

Brewer's yeast or baker's yeast are two common names for the species [*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/4932) , for which the scientifically correct name was first applied to a strain observed in malt circa 1837. These common names neatly reflect the major interests this organism holds for the majority of people. It is one of the earliest "domesticated" organisms, and while initially appreciated for its alcohol producing or dough leavening capabilities, the simple yeast soon became an important organism for research too.

The ease with which yeast can be cultivated and genetically manipulated made it a useful tool in the early days of biotechnological and biomedical research, where it was utilized for the production of pharmaceuticals and enzymes (a name that originates from the latin 'enzymi' = in yeast). *S.cerevisiae* has subsequently proven to be an extremely useful experimental model system for the study of the basic biological structures and processes of the eukaryotic cell. It is therefore not surprising that it was one of the first eukaryotic species targeted by large-scale sequencing efforts, and in 1996, researchers were able to celebrate the completion of the first eukaryotic genome sequence.

One decade later, and coincident with the [20th anniversary of Swiss-Prot](http://www.uniprot.org/news/2006/07/25/release) , yeast is again in the headlines, representing the first complete eukaryotic proteome integrated into Swiss-Prot, the manually curated section of the UniProt knowledgebase. In the current release of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot there are more than 6000 yeast entries containing every gene of the yeast genome believed to code for a protein. Each entry contains literature-curated annotations and numerous cross-references, the locus identifier, which maps a protein to its corresponding genomic locus, and a cross-reference to the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD; [www.yeastgenome.org](http://www.yeastgenome.org/) ), the community-designated repository for the reference genome sequence. A summary of all yeast entries including these references is listed in the file [yeast.txt](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/yeast) .

In the 10 years since the initial release of the *S.cerevisiae* genome, the annotation of protein encoding genes has continually evolved. New open reading frames have been identified and existing predicted ORFs have been revised or retired. In collaboration with SGD we have revisited and updated all entries for which the protein sequence has been changed since the initial release in order to provide users with a set of yeast proteins that corresponds to the most current view of the yeast proteome.

Ten years of post-genomic research have yielded a wealth of information on yeast proteins and we will continually revisit yeast entries to update their functional annotation. *S.cerevisiae* continues to be at the forefront of experimental molecular biology, particularly in the field of proteomics, and the availability of the complete proteome in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot will facilitate the mapping and integration of results from large-scale proteomic studies. S.cerevisiae will also serve in the future as one of the model systems for functional annotation in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. As one of the best-characterized of the eukaryotic organisms, its proteins will provide many templates for the creation and annotation of fungal-specific or broader eukaryotic protein families.
