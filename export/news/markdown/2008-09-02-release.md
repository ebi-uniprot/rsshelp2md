### First draft of the complete human proteome available in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot

The UniProt consortium is pleased to announce that a manually annotated representation of all the currently known human protein-coding genes is available in this release of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. This represents [20,325 entries](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy%3A9606+AND+reviewed%3Ayes) . More than a [third of these](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy%3A9606+AND+%28keyword%3A%22Alternative+initiation+%5B24%5D%22+OR+keyword%3A%22Alternative+promoter+usage+%5B877%5D%22+OR+keyword%3A%22Alternative+splicing+%5B25%5D%22%29%0D%0A) contain additional sequences representing isoforms generated by alternative splicing, alternative promoter usage and/or alternative translation initiation, resulting in close to 34,000 human protein sequences. Approximately 46,000 single amino acid polymorphisms (SAPs), mostly disease-linked, are also described, as well as 60,000 post-translational modifications (PTMs) (for additional statistics, click [here](http://www.uniprot.org/program/chordata/statistics) ).

It is not the first time that UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot has provided a fully annotated proteome for a model organism (for example [*E.coli*](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy:83333+AND+keyword:181) or [*S.cerevisiae*](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy:4932+AND+keyword:181) ) and there are many more planned in the near and more distant future ( [*A.thaliana*](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy:3702+AND+reviewed%3Ayes) , [*B.subtilis*](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy:1423+AND+reviewed%3Ayes) , [*D.discoideum*](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy:44689+AND+reviewed%3Ayes) , [mouse](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy:10090+AND+reviewed%3Ayes) , [rice](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy:39947+AND+reviewed%3Ayes) , [*S.aureus*](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=organism%3A%22Staphylococcus+aureus%22+AND+reviewed%3Ayes) , [*S.pombe*](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy:4896+AND+reviewed%3Ayes) , etc). But we do not expect that there will ever be anything as important as this proteome. For the first time, we can present to the life sciences community a clean set of what we believe to be a full (although still imperfect!) representation of human proteins. It is the ultimate goal of the life sciences to fully understand *Homo sapiens* at the molecular level and we hope this set will significantly contribute to this extraordinary adventure.

There are still many challenging tasks in front of us. We will create entries for newly discovered human proteins, review and update the existing set, increase the number of splice variants, explore the full range of PTMs and continue to build a comprehensive view of protein variation in the human population. The characterization at the molecular level will need to be placed in its physiological context: subcellular location, tissue expression, protein/protein interaction, etc. And last but not the least, we all want to understand the role of all these actors of our life processes.

The way is paved, but the road will be long before we fully understand life at a molecular level.
