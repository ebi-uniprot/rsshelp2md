This subsection of the ' [Interaction](http://www.uniprot.org/help/interaction%5Fsection)' section provides information about binary protein-protein interactions. The data presented in this section are a quality-filtered subset of binary interactions automatically derived from the [IntAct database](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/). It is updated at every [UniProt release](http://www.uniprot.org/help/synchronization).

For UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries that describe more than one protein ( [isoforms](http://www.uniprot.org/help/alternative%5Fproducts) or/and products of proteolytic cleavage, i.e. [CHAIN](http://www.uniprot.org/help/chain) or [PEPTIDE](http://www.uniprot.org/help/peptide)), each of these protein forms has its interactions listed in a separate block.

Interactions with the displayed protein, or with one of its isoforms or proteolytic products, are shown in tables of 3 columns:

- The 'With' column reports the gene name and the UniProtKB accession number of the interacting protein. If the interaction partner is a specific isoform or a product of proteolytic cleavage, this information includes the isoform name and identifier, or the peptide/chain name and identifier. Interacting proteins may be derived from different species, e.g. due to the experimental design or reflecting a pathogen-host interaction. In such cases, the organism of the interacting protein is included.



Example:[Q8WUM4](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q8WUM4#interaction)

- The '#Exp' column indicates the number of experiments in the IntAct database which support the interaction.

- The 'IntAct' column contains the IntAct database accession numbers of the two interacting proteins.

Homotypic interactions are indicated by the presence of the qualifier 'itself' in the 'With' column.

Example: [P62258](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P62258#interaction)

Homotypic interactions are listed before heteromeric interactions, which are sorted alphanumerically based on their gene name.

Example: [Q64279](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q64279#interaction)

UniProtKB 'Binary interactions' are automatically derived from the IntAct database, but represent [only a subset of the binary interactions found in IntAct](http://www.uniprot.org/help/binary%5Finteractions%5Fimport). The complete IntAct set can be accessed using the link in the 'Cross-references' section.

Example: [P51617](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P51617#cross%2Dreferences) (Protein-protein interaction databases)

More examples: [P62258](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P62258#interaction), [Q8T4F7](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q8T4F7#interaction), [P02829](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P02829#interaction), [O43521](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/O43521#interaction), [Q07817](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q07817#interaction)
