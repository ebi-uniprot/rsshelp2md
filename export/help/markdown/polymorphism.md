This subsection of the 'Sequence' section provides information on polymorphic variants. If the variant is associated with a disease state, the description of the latter can be found in the ['Involvement in disease'](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/involvement%5Fin%5Fdisease) subsection.

Comments on single variants are usually found in the ' [Natural variant](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/variant) ' subsection. The subsection 'Polymorphism' is used only when the information cannot be accommodated in the ' [Natural variant](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/variant) ' subsection.  
Example: [P15516](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P15516#sequences)

This subsection may contain OMIM accession numbers, if available.  
Example: [P59533](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P59533#sequences)

It can be used to describe global variations in the population, such as blood group systems or polymorphic repeats.  
Example: [Q92482](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q92482#sequences) , [P10275](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P10275#sequences)  
Since repeat expansion may lead to disease onset, both subsections ' [Polymorphism](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/polymorphism) ' and ' [Involvement in disease](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/involvement_in_disease) ' may be present in an entry.  
Examples: [P54259](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P54259#sequences) , [P42858](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P42858#sequences)

Alleles described in this subsection follow the official nomenclature.  
Example: [Q03519](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q03519#sequences)
