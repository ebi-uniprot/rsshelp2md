This subsection of the 'PTM / Processing' section describes the position and length of an active peptide in the mature protein.

An active peptide is defined as a small polypeptide (\<= 40 to 50 amino acid long) that is processed (e.g.Â by proteolytic cleavage) from a larger precursor protein and has a well defined biological activity on its own.

The processing events that may contribute to the formation of a mature peptide are described in the ['Initiator methionine'](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/init_met) , ['Propeptide'](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/propep) , ['Signal'](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/signal) and ['Transit peptide'](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/transit) subsections.

The 'Description' field of each 'Peptide' corresponds to the peptide name listed in the ['Protein name'](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/protein%5Fname) subsection, under the heading "Cleaved into the following x chains:", where 'x' represents the number of chains described in the 'PTM/Processing' section.

There can be more than one 'Peptide' subsection per protein entry.  
Example: [Q9SE35](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q9SE35#ptm%5Fprocessing)

Each peptide has a [stable identifier](http://www.uniprot.org/help/sequence%5Fannotation#annotation%5Fid) .
