This section provides information on the expression of a gene at the mRNA or protein level in cells or in tissues of multicellular organisms.

The information is filed in different subsections. The current subsections and their content are listed below:

**Subsection**

[Tissue specificity](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/tissue_specificity)

Description of the expression of a gene in different tissues

[Developmental stage](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/developmental_stage)

Description of how the expression of a gene varies according to the stage of cell, tissue or organism development

[Induction](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/induction)

Description of the effects of environmental factors on the gene expression

[Keywords 'Developmental stage'](http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW-9996)

Selection of controlled vocabulary which summarises the content of an entry
