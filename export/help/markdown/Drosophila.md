The Drosophila protein annotation project focuses on the manual annotation of characterised *D.melanogaster* proteins with experimental information propagated to orthologous proteins in other Drosophila species.

See: [How do we manually annotate a UniProtKB entry?](http://www.uniprot.org/faq/45)

UniProtKB works closely with [FlyBase](http://flybase.org/) , the database for Drosophila genetics and molecular biology, to ensure consistency of data between the two resources.

## About Drosophila

[*Drosophila melanogaster*](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/7227) is a fruit fly and one of the most studied species from the family Drosophilidae. It is about 3mm long, has a short life cycle of just two weeks and is cheap and easy to keep in large numbers. These aspects have made the organism valuable for studies in biological research, particularly in genetics and developmental biology. Drosophila has been used as a model organism for research for over a century, and several thousand scientists are known to be working on many different aspects of the fruit fly. Its importance for human health was recognised by the award of the Nobel Prize in medicine/physiology to Ed Lewis, Christiane Nusslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschaus in 1995 for their research on the genetic control of embryonic development.

The second Drosophilid genome to be sequenced was [*Drosophila pseudoobscura pseudoobscura*](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/46245) and 10 more genomes are now available:  
[*D. ananassae*](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/7217) , [*D. erecta*](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/7220) ,  
[*D. grimshawi*](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/7222) , [*D. mojavensis*](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/7230) ,  
[*D. persimilis*](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/7234) , [*D. sechellia*](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/7238) ,  
[*D. simulans*](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/7240) , [*D. virilis*](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/7244) , [*D. willistoni*](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/7260) and [*D. yakuba*](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/7245) . These species were chosen to span a wide variety of evolutionary distances, from closely related pairs such as *D. sechellia* and *D. simulans* , to distantly related species such as *D. persimilis* and *D. pseudoobscura pseudoobscura* .
