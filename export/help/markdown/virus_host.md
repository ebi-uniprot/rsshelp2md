This subsection of the [Names and taxonomy](http://www.uniprot.org/help/names%5Fand%5Ftaxonomy%5Fsection) section only exists in viral entries and indicates the host(s) either as a specific organism or taxonomic group of organisms that are susceptible to be infected by a virus.

A virus being an inert particle outside its hosts, the virion has neither metabolism, nor replication capability, nor autonomous evolution. A virus is a living organism only if we consider it associated with its host. Viruses of the same family can infect a wide range of hosts. Identifying the host organism(s) is therefore essential, because features like virus-cell interactions and post-translational modifications depend mostly on the host.

The 'Virus host' name consists of the official organism name and, optionally, a common name and/or synonym.
