This subsection of the [Sequence](http://www.uniprot.org/help/sequences%5Fsection) section indicates if the [canonical sequence](http://www.uniprot.org/help/canonical%5Fand%5Fisoforms) displayed by default in the entry is complete or not.

-   If the sequence is complete, the term 'Complete' is used.  
    Example: [Q04826](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/q04826#sequences)

<!-- -->

-   If the sequence is a fragment, the term 'Fragment' is used.  
    Example: [P29306](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/p29306#sequences)

<!-- -->

-   If the sequence is composed of several fragments, the term 'Fragments' is used (see for instance: [P0C2W2](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/p0c2w2#sequences) ). In the ['Sequences'](https://www.uniprot.org/help/sequences) section, the missing amino acids are either replaced by the letter 'X' (see for instance: [P0C2W2](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/p0c2w2#sequences) ) or the missing amino acids are not represented. In this case, the non-adjacent amino acids are annotated in the ['Non-adjacent residue'](https://www.uniprot.org/help/non%5fcons) subsection of the 'Sequences' section (see for instance: [P68251](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/p68251#sequences) ).

To exclude fragments from your query results, you can add the search term `fragment:no` to your query.
