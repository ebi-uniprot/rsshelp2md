Information relevant to diseases associated with a given protein are found in the section 'Pathology and Biotech'. The information given (including the disease name) is consistent with the literature and the [OMIM database](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=omim) .

You can use three methods to search proteins associated with a given disease.

1\) Search for proteins using the [query builder](http://www.uniprot.org/help/advanced%5Fsearch) :

-   Select `Protein Knowledgebase (UniProtKB)` from the dataset dropdown next to the search box
-   Click **Advanced** to open the query builder
-   Select **Field** : `Pathology and Biotech` , or start typing "disease" in the text box with the grey text "Search for field"
-   Type the name of a disease in the **Term** box (e.g. 'adrenal hyperplasia')
-   Click on the looking glass icon to launch the search
-   **[result](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/?query=annotation%3A%28type%3Adisease+%22adrenal+hyperplasia%22%29)**

2\) Search via the controlled vocabulary of human diseases:

-   Select `Human diseases` from the dataset dropdown next to the search box, or go to the [Human diseases page](http://www.uniprot.org/diseases)
-   Enter a search term or use the **Advanced search** (e.g. [adrenal hyperplasia](http://www.uniprot.org/diseases/?query=adrenal+hyperplasia) )
-   Browse through your results, choose a disease (e.g. Adrenal hyperplasia 4) and click on the [UniProtKB](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/?query=disease:DI-00044 "xxx") link below it.

3\) Browse by keyword:

Some proteins involved in a specific non-monogenic disease are associated with specialized 'disease' keywords ( ['Diabetes mellitus'](http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/219) , ['Cataract'](http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/898) , ['Alzheimer disease'](http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/26) ...)

-   Go to the [keywords page](http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/)
-   Click the keyword category `'Disease'`
-   Browse the keywords navigation table
-   Click your chosen term, e.g. ['Diabetes mellitus'](http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/219)
-   Click `'UniProtKB'` to view corresponding proteins

Note 1: Currently, these keywords apply mainly to non-monogenic diseases.

Note 2: The keyword `'Disease variant'` is used for proteins with at least one disease-associated variant. Variants are described in the 'Pathology and Biotech' and in the 'Sequence' sections of a protein entry.
