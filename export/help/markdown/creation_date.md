### When was sequence Xxxx published? When was sequence Xxxx submitted?

The answer to these questions is dependent on what you really want this information for! If it is for legal reasons, this is a non-issue: most sequence data is NOT directly deposited in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, but originates from translation of a DNA sequence entry which has been itself deposited in EMBL-Bank, GenBank or DDBJ.

The [Entry history](http://www.uniprot.org/help/entry%5Fhistory) subsection of the [Entry information](http://www.uniprot.org/help/entry%5Finformation%5Fsection) section shows the date on which the entry was first integrated into the database, the date of the last sequence update and the date of the last annotation modification. The version number for both the entry and the sequence are also displayed.

Example: [P55209](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P55209#entry%5Finformation)

Integrated into UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: October 1, 1996
Last sequence update:                 October 1, 1996
Last modified:                        November 11, 2015
This is version 148 of the entry and version 1 of the sequence. \[Complete history\]

The first line indicates when the entry first appeared in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. But this is not the date it was submitted to a database. As about 98% of the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries are derived from the translation of one or more DNA sequences, it is therefore in the DNA databases that one should seek the date of submission of a particular sequence. One should also note that a high proportion of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries are produced by merging information from various sequence and non-sequence reports, each of these reports having originated at different time frames.

However, when a protein sequence is directly submitted to UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and not published in a journal, it will contain this type of information in the [Publications](http://www.uniprot.org/help/publications%5Fsection) section:

Submitted (JAN-2002) to Swiss-Prot.

Such a line will be superseded by the correct journal citation once it is available.

Example:

Curr. Microbiol. 36:158-163(2003).

**Entry complete history**

A comprehensive archive of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and UniProtKB/TrEMBL entry versions is available (click on the 'History' button, and then on 'Previous versions'). Unlike the UniProt Knowledgebase, which contains only the latest Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL entry and sequence versions, this archive provides access to all versions of UniProtKB entries. This allows the tracking of sequence changes and analysis of the way annotation has evolved for any given entry.
