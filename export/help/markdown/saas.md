UniProt's [Automatic Annotation pipeline](http://www.uniprot.org/help/automatic%5Fannotation) enhances the unreviewed records in UniProtKB by enriching them with automatic classification and annotation.

The Statistical Automatic Annotation System SAAS used to be one of the contributors to this pipeline, but as of release 2020\_04 it has been replaced by the [Association-Rule-Based Annotator (ARBA)](http://www.uniprot.org/help/arba) .
