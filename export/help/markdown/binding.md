This subsection of the [Function](http://www.uniprot.org/help/function%5Fsection) section describes the interaction between a single amino acid and another chemical entity. Priority is given to the annotation of physiological ligands.

A group of ligand-binding residues that are separated by no more than three residues is shown as a ' [Region](https://www.uniprot.org/help/region) '

The general nature of the ligand (substrate, carbohydrate etc.) is indicated in the 'Description field. If defined, the exact chemical composition is also provided.  
Example: [P83790](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/p83790#function)

When the chemical entity that binds the amino acid is a metal, this information is stored in the ' [Metal binding](https://www.uniprot.org/help/metal) ' subsection.  
Example: [P24146](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/p24146#function)

By default, the interaction involves the amino acid side chain. For interactions mediated via the nitrogen atoms of the histidine side chain, we indicate, when known, which nitrogen is involved: Pros is the term used for the nitrogen atom that is closest to the alpha-carbon, and tele for the other.  
Example: [Q57I19](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/q57i19#function) , [P73925](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/p73925#function)

Interactions which occur via the backbone oxygen or nitrogen are also specified.  
Example: [Q8CFV9](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/q8cfv9#function)

Interactions are considered to be non-covalent by default. When a substance is covalently bound with a cofactor or a prosthetic group, this is indicated by using the qualifier 'covalent'.  
Example: [P81280](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/p81280#function)

For residues of enzymes that bind both to the substrate and the product of the reaction we have chosen to indicate binding to the substrate.  
Example: [P08019](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/p08019#function)

This subsection complements the information on covalent binding described in the ' [Modified residue](https://www.uniprot.org/help/mod_res) ', ' [Glycosylation](https://www.uniprot.org/help/carbohyd) ' and ' [Lipidation](https://www.uniprot.org/help/lipid) ' subsections as well as the information in the ' [Active site](https://www.uniprot.org/help/act_site) ' subsection concerning unstable reaction intermediates.
