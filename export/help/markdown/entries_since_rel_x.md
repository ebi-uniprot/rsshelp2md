1.  Go to the [news archive](http://www.uniprot.org/news) and find the date of the UniProt release under consideration, e.g. Release 12.0 was published on July 24, 2007
2.  Use the query builder as described below.

Retrieve all green plant entries:

-   Select **Search in** : `Protein Knowledgebase (UniProtKB)`
-   Click **Advanced** to open the query builder
-   Select **Field** : `Taxonomy [OC]`
-   Type `Viridiplantae` (use autocompletion)

Restrict results to data integrated since release 12.0:

-   Select **Field** : `Date of` - `Date of creation`
-   Type **From** : `20070724`
-   Click **Search**

You can choose to view only [reviewed](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot?query=taxonomy:viridiplantae+created:%5B20070724+TO+%2A%5D+reviewed:yes) (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot) or [unreviewed](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot?query=taxonomy:viridiplantae+created:%5B20070724+TO+%2A%5D+reviewed:no) (UniProtKB/TrEMBL) entries.

Note that the date can be modified in the query box 'taxonomy:Viridiplantae AND created:\[20070724 TO \*\]' and that you can bookmark the result page.
