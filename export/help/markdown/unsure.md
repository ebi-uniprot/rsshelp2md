This subsection of the 'Sequences' section is used to describe region(s) of a sequence for which the authors are unsure about the sequence assignment.

Example: [P56576](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/p56576#sequences)

When a protein belongs to a family, we display the most frequent amino acid found at that position in other family members. This is indicated in the 'description' field.  
Example: [P00279](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/p00279#sequences)
