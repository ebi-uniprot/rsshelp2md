This subsection of the [Sequence](http://www.uniprot.org/help/sequences%5Fsection) section indicates if the [canonical sequence](http://www.uniprot.org/help/canonical%5Fand%5Fisoforms) displayed by default in the entry is in its mature form or if it represents the precursor.

### The canonical sequence is a precursor

If the canonical sequence requires processing to become mature, the following comment is found in the 'Sequence processing' subsection: 'The displayed sequence is further processed into a mature form.'  
Example: [P01308](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/p01308#sequences)

Processing of the precursor includes signal peptide and propeptide cleavage, transit peptide cleavage or initiator methionine cleavage. The processing required for maturation is described in the [PTM / Processing](http://www.uniprot.org/help/ptm%5Fprocessing%5Fsection) section.  
Examples: [P01308](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/p01308#ptm%5Fprocessing) , [Q99K67](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/q99k67#ptm%5Fprocessing) , [P68250](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/p68250#ptm%5Fprocessing)

### Other case

If there is no evidence for further processing (e.g.Â the canonical sequence represents the mature form), there is no 'Sequence processing' subsection.  
Example: [O60437](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/o60437#sequences)

Remark: There is also no 'Sequence processing' subsection if the canonical sequence is not yet known to require further processing.
