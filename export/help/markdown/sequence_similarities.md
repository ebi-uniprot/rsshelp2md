categories: Family_and_domains,manual

This subsection of the 'Family and domains' section provides information about the sequence similarity with other proteins.

This subsection only states sequence similarity, thus excluding proteins with a related name that may function in the same biological pathway, but do not share sequence similarities.

The 'Sequence similarities' subsection provides information on protein families the protein **belongs to** .

The lines are listed in alphanumerical order.

Examples: [Q9C9W3](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/q9c9w3#family_and_domains) , [Q03395](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/q03395#family_and_domains) , [Q15022](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/q15022#family_and_domains) , [P0A6X0](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/p0a6x0#family_and_domains) , [O31792](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/o31792#family_and_domains)

A protein may belong to two (or even more) different families. In this case, we indicate which part of the protein belongs to a given family.

Example: [P40939](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/p40939#family_and_domains) , [O75521](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/o75521#family_and_domains)
