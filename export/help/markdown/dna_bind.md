This subsection of the [Function](http://www.uniprot.org/help/function%5Fsection) section specifies the position and type of each DNA-binding domain present within the protein.

We annotate experimentally defined DNA-binding domains and conserved DNA-binding domains defined by the InterPro resources PROSITE, Pfam and SMART; examples include the AP2/ERF domain, the ETS domain, the Fork-Head domain, the HMG box and the Myb domain.

#### Special types of DNA-binding domain

##### a. bHLH and bZIP proteins

In the case of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and basic leucine-zipper (bZIP) domains, we describe the C-terminal HLH and leucine zipper motifs separately in the [Domain](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/domain) subsection of the 'Family and Domains' section. The N-terminal basic region of these domains is described in the 'DNA-binding' subsection.

For bHLH proteins, the basic region is usually directly followed by the HLH domain in the sequence.  
Example: [P35869](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P35869#family%5Fand%5Fdomains)

In bZIP proteins, the basic region is followed by the leucine-zipper domain, characterized by an LXXXXXXL motif, and begins with the first Leu/Ile and stops with the last Leu/Ile residues.  
Examples: [P18289](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P18289#family_and_domains) , [P15407](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P15407#family_and_domains)

##### b. Homeobox proteins

Homeobox proteins constitute a large family which contains several subtypes. When a homeobox belongs to a subtype, it is indicated in the 'Description' field after 'Homeobox' preceded by a semicolon.  
Examples: [Q9H2P0](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q9H2P0#function) , [O81788](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/O81788#function) , [Q90655](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q90655#function) , [P20823](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P20823#function)

When a particular homeobox is incomplete or differs significantly from the consensus it may be annotated as either 'partial' or 'atypical'.  
Examples: [Q6WRX8](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q6WRX8#function) , [Q8MJD5](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q8MJD5#function)

### 2. Experimentally determined DNA-binding domains {#2\_\_Experimentally_determined_DNA_binding_domains}

When a DNA-binding domain has been identified experimentally but does not correspond to a domain modelled by an InterPro resource, then the simple fact of the existence of the domain is indicated but no particular description is provided.  
Example: [P13574](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P13574#function)

Such domains are transferred to close species using the 'By similarity' qualifier.  
Example: [Q08400](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q08400#function)
