### 7-transmembrane G-linked receptors {\#7\_transmembrane\_G\_linked\_receptors}

7-transmembrane G-linked receptors (also known as G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), seven-transmembrane domain receptors, 7TM receptors, heptahelical receptors, serpentine receptor and G protein-linked receptors (GPLR)) constitute a large protein family of receptors that sense molecules outside the cell and activate inside signal transduction pathways and cellular responses.

### Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are enzymes that activate an amino acid for translation by forming an aminoacyladenylate intermediate and then link this activated amino acid to the corresponding tRNA molecule. In general, a specific aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase is available for the 20 amino acids.

### Intein-containing proteins

Protein splicing is defined as the excision of an intervening protein sequence (the intein) from a protein precursor and the concomitant ligation of the flanking protein fragments (the exteins) to form a mature extein protein and the free intein. Protein splicing results in a native peptide bond between the ligated exteins.

### Translation initiation factors

Translation initiation factors are proteins that bind to the small subunit of the ribosome during the initiation of translation, a part of protein biosynthesis.

### Uncharacterized protein families (UPF)

Uncharacterized proteins which share regions of similarities are classified as 'Uncharacterized protein families (UPF)' according to the Prosite database.
