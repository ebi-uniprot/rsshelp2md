title: Activity regulation
categories: Function,manual
---

This subsection of the [Function](http://www.uniprot.org/help/function%5Fsection) section describes regulatory mechanisms for enzymes, transporters or microbial transcription factors, and reports the components which regulate (by activation or inhibition) the reaction.

Example: [P17289](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/p17289#function)

A regulation can be allosteric, performed by natural or synthetic products or may be due to a post-translational modification (PTM).  
Examples: [P0A9C5](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/p0a9c5#function) , [Q96EB6](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/q96eb6#function)

This subsection describes the regulation at the protein level. We do not describe genetic regulation.

Note that the absence of a regulation can also be reported (usually if other members of the family are regulated by a given component).

This annotation topic used to be called "Enzyme regulation" prior to release 2018\_08.
