obtained by direct protein sequencing (see also [Do you have a protein to share with the world? - UniProt blog](http://insideuniprot.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/do-you-have-protein-to-share-with-world.html)).

![](http://www.uniprot.org/images/webin.png) [ **Submit nucleotide sequences**](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/Submission/webin.html)

the translations of these sequences will be entered into UniProtKB automatically (see also [What is the synchronization delay with other databases?](http://www.uniprot.org/help/synchronization)).

#### Guidelines for submitting updates or corrections to UniProtKB data.

What to send?

We are grateful for **any feedback**, but welcome especially:  
  
› sequence updates  
  
› post-translational modifications  
  
› confirmation at the protein level of part of a DNA translated sequence  
  
› functional information  
  
› presence of specific domains in the sequence  
  
› alternative names for the protein or the gene coding for it  
  
› subunit structure  
  
› mass-spectrometry data  
  
› strain name  
  

What format?

If you are familiar with the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot format we encourage you to submit your updates and/or corrections using that format, but this is not a prerequisite and we prefer that you provide a longer textual description of what you are submitting rather than spend time trying to fit your data to our format.

Whose work?

When reporting:  
  
› _published information_: please provide the complete reference (authors lists with initials, journal, volume, page range and year) or a PubMed identifier  
  
› _unpublished information_: please provide the name of the people associated with a particular item of information  
  

Note that you don't have to be the original author to submit us updates, and can therefore report anybody's work.

What sequence position?

Whenever you are reporting data relevant to a particular position or stretch of residues in a sequence, always use an absolute numbering system that starts with the first residue of the sequence in the entry.

What next?

A UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot annotator will mail the revised sequence entry back to you. Any further comments can be sent directly to that annotator.

Where is my data?

UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot is a curated database and not an unedited archive or repository. We are therefore making no promise as to whether we will accept to represent in a given entry all data sent to us. But when we do not make use of some item of information, we will report back.
