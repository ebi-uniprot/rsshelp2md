<div id="guidelines">

#### Guidelines for submitting updates or corrections to UniProtKB data.

<table class="two-column"><colgroup><col style="width: 50%" /><col style="width: 50%" /></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><th>What to send?</th><td>We are grateful for <strong>any feedback</strong> , but welcome especially:<br />
› sequence updates<br />
› post-translational modifications<br />
› confirmation at the protein level of part of a DNA translated sequence<br />
› functional information<br />
› presence of specific domains in the sequence<br />
› alternative names for the protein or the gene coding for it<br />
› subunit structure<br />
› mass-spectrometry data<br />
› strain name<br />
</td></tr><tr class="even"><th>What format?</th><td>If you are familiar with the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot format we encourage you to submit your updates and/or corrections using that format, but this is not a prerequisite and we prefer that you provide a longer textual description of what you are submitting rather than spend time trying to fit your data to our format.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><th>Whose work?</th><td>When reporting:<br />
› <em>published information</em> : please provide the complete reference (authors lists with initials, journal, volume, page range and year) or a PubMed identifier<br />
› <em>unpublished information</em> : please provide the name of the people associated with a particular item of information<br />
<p>Note that you don't have to be the original author to submit us updates, and can therefore report anybody's work.</p></td></tr><tr class="even"><th>What sequence position?</th><td>Whenever you are reporting data relevant to a particular position or stretch of residues in a sequence, always use an absolute numbering system that starts with the first residue of the sequence in the entry.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><th>What next?</th><td>A UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot annotator will mail the revised sequence entry back to you. Any further comments can be sent directly to that annotator.</td></tr><tr class="even"><th>Where is my data?</th><td>UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot is a curated database and not an unedited archive or repository. We are therefore making no promise as to whether we will accept to represent in a given entry all data sent to us. But when we do not make use of some item of information, we will report back.</td></tr></tbody></table>
