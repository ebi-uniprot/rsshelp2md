This subsection of the 'PTM / Processing' section describes the extent of a polypeptide chain in the mature protein following processing or proteolytic cleavage.

The processing events that may contribute to the formation of a mature chain are described in the ' [Initiator methionine](https://www.uniprot.org/help/init_met) ', ' [Propeptide](https://www.uniprot.org/help/propep) ', ' [Signal](https://www.uniprot.org/help/signal) ' and ' [Transit peptide](https://www.uniprot.org/help/transit) ' subsections.

The 'description' field of the 'chain' corresponds to the recommended name listed in the ' [Protein names](https://www.uniprot.org/help/protein_names) ' subsection.  
Example: [Q6UB98](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/q6ub98#ptm_processing)

When several chains are produced from the same precursor, each chain is described in this subsection and is also listed in the [Names and taxonomy](http://www.uniprot.org/help/names%5Fand%5Ftaxonomy%5Fsection) section, ['Protein name'](https://www.uniprot.org/help/protein%5fname) subsection, as "Cleaved into the following x chains:", where 'x' represents the number of chains described in the 'PTM / Processing' section. In both sections, the chains are listed in their order of appearance in the sequence, i.e.Â from the N- to the C-terminus.  
Example: [P07683, 'PTM / Processing'](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/p07683#ptm%5Fprocessing) and [P07683, 'Names and taxonomy'](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/p07683#names%5Fand%5Ftaxonomy)

Each chain has a [stable identifier](http://www.uniprot.org/help/sequence%5Fannotation#annotation%5Fid) .
