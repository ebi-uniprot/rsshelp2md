### Journals (citations/publications)

The [Controlled vocabulary of journals](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/jourlist) lists the journal abbreviations used in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. The abbreviations are those proposed by the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) and they generally correspond to those used by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) in PubMed.

### Keywords

The [Controlled vocabulary of keywords](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/keywlist) lists the keywords and keyword categories used in the UniProt knowledgebase (Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL).

### Subcellular locations

The [Controlled vocabulary of subcellular locations and membrane topologies and orientations](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/subcell) lists the UniProtKB controlled vocabulary used for the subcellular locations (including the membrane topologies and orientations terms) in the 'Subcellular location' section.

### Pathways

The [Controlled vocabulary of metabolic pathways](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/pathlist) lists the UniProtKB controlled vocabulary used for the subsection 'Pathway' of the 'Function' section. It provides definitions of the terms as well as other relevant information for [UniPathway](http://www.unipathway.org/) concepts (pathway, sub-pathway, enzymatic reaction (step))

### Plasmids

The [Controlled vocabulary of plasmids](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/plasmid) lists the currently valid values for the plasmids cited in the [Encoded on](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/encoded%5Fon) subsection of the 'Names and origin' section and in the [Reference](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/references) section of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries.

### Post-translational modifications

The [Controlled vocabulary of posttranslational modifications (PTM)](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/ptmlist) lists the posttranslational modifications (PTM) used in the sequence annotation section of the UniProt knowledgebase (Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL). Additional information such as amino acid target, subcellular location, monoisotopic mass difference, average mass difference, taxonomic range, corresponding keyword etc. are listed when available.

### Taxonomy

#### Species

The [Controlled vocabulary of species](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/speclist) contains two sublists: the *Real organism codes* , which are used in both UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and UniProtKB/TrEMBL and which correspond to a specific and specified organism; the *Virtual organism codes* that regroup organisms at a certain taxonomic level. They generally correspond to a 'pool' of organisms and are used only in UniProtKB/TrEMBL.

#### Strains

The [Controlled vocabulary of strains](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/strains) lists the most frequently occurring values for the 'Strain' topic in the [Reference](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/references) section of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries.

### Tissues

The [Controlled vocabulary of tissues](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/tisslist) lists the currently valid values and their synomym(s) for the tissues cited in the [Reference](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/references) section of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries.

### Human diseases

The [Controlled vocabulary of human diseases](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/humdisease) lists the controlled vocabulary that is used for the annotation of human diseases in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. Each record in this file consists of a disease identifier, acronym, and description, as well as known disease synonyms, links to OMIM, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and associated UniProtKB keywords.

### Extracellular domains

The document: [Nomenclature of extracellular domains](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/extradom) lists the nomenclature proposal for domains (or modules) found mainly in extracellular proteins of higher eukaryotes. These domains are described in the 'Sequence annotation' section of entries.
