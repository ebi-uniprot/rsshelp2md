This subsection of the 'Family and domains' section provides general information on the biological role of a domain. The term 'domain' is intended here in its wide acceptation, it may be a structural domain, a transmembrane region or a functional domain. Several domains are described in this subsection.

The domains described in this subsection are generally also described at the [sequence level](https://www.uniprot.org/help/domain) (cf.Â 'Domains and Repeats' subsection).  
Example: [Q96NN9](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/q96nn9#family%5Fand%5Fdomains)

This subsection contains also information, such as the location, length and function of domains that have no precise name and that cannot be described at the sequence level.  
Example: [Q9BZZ5](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/q9bzz5#family%5Fand%5Fdomains)
