A UniProt [proteome](https://www.uniprot.org/help/proteomes%5fmanual) can consist of several components.  
The component name refers to the genomic component encoding a set of proteins.

These range from a single component such as Viral genomes to several components as in the case of eukaryotic chromosomes. They may also represent different stages in a genome project and include components such as contigs, scaffolds or Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) master records.
