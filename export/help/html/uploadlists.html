  Select the
  <strong>
   Retrieve/ID mapping
  </strong>
  tab of the toolbar and enter or upload a list of identifiers (or gene names) to do one of the following:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Retrieve the corresponding UniProt entries to download them or work with them on this website.
  </li>
  <li>
   Convert identifiers which are of a different type to UniProt identifiers or vice versa, and download the identifier lists.
  </li>
 </ul>

  How to use this tool
 </h4>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Enter identifiers or upload them from a file, separated by a space or a new line, into the form field, for example: P31946 P62258 ALBU_HUMAN
  </li>
  <li>
   If you need to convert to another identifier type (as performed previously by the "ID mapping" service), select the source and target type from the "From/To" dropdown menus under "Options". Otherwise, to retrieve or download a list UniProtKB entries, keep the default selection of these menus (from UniProtKB AC/ID to UniProtKB)
  </li>
  <li>
   Click the
   <strong>
    Submit
   </strong>
   button.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  The following kinds of UniProt identifiers are supported:
 </p>

  When mapping from a source database external to UniProt, you can submit any identifier as used in the UniProtKB
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/cross%5Freferences%5Fsection">
   cross-references
  </a>
  . If your job is not successful and you are not sure which source database to use, try a text search in UniProtKB with one of your identifiers, and look at an example entry. Check out the cross-reference section to find out which database uses these identifiers.
 </p>
 <h4 id="Further_queries_involving_your_UniProtKB_data_sets">
  Further queries involving your UniProtKB data sets
 </h4>
 <p>
  After you have submitted your data, you are forwarded to a query result page showing the correspondence of submitted identifiers (from external databases, or obsolete UniProtKB identifiers) with current UniProtKB accession numbers. You can use the
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/basket">
   basket
  </a>
  , download and align services like in any query result, as well as
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/customize">
   reconfigure the table layout
  </a>
  ("Columns") or add additional constraints to your query.
 </p>
 <p>
  Jobs have unique
  <strong>
   identifiers
  </strong>
  , which (depending on the job type) can be used in queries (e.g. to get the intersection of two sequence similarity searches). Job identifiers and the related data are kept for 7 days, and are then deleted.

 <h4 id="Unmapped_identifiers">
  Unmapped identifiers
 </h4>
 <p>
  The list of identifiers that could not be mapped can be retrieved for further inspection or analysis.
 </p>
 <p>
  When mapping popular sequence database identifiers such as RefSeq, gi numbers, EMBL, EMBLCDS to UniProtKB, unmapped identifiers can be further mapped to
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/uniparc">
   UniParc
  </a>
  . This can be particularly useful for proteins from

 <ul>
  <li>
   Very large mapping requests (&gt;50,000 identifiers) are likely to fail. Please do verify that your list does not contain any duplicates, and try to split it into smaller chunks (&lt;20,000) in case of problems. If you prefer to run your mapping locally, you can also
   <a href="https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current%5Frelease/knowledgebase/idmapping/">
    download the data underlying this service
   </a>
   .
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>
   For performance reasons, databases where the mapping relationship to UniProtKB identifiers is one-to-many, e.g. GO, InterPro or PubMed, are not supported. For limited lists of such identifiers, it is possible to query UniProtKB using the text search form with identifiers combined by "or", e.g.
   <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=%22interpro+IPR014000%22+or+%22interpro+IPR014002%22+or+%22interpro+IPR014003%22">
    "interpro IPR014000" OR "interpro IPR014002" OR "interpro IPR014003"
   </a>
   . One can then further use the
   <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/customize">
    Columns
   </a>
   button to remove unwanted columns from the table view, or edit the query string (URL) to add "&amp;columns=id,database(interpro)" to it. The same addition can be made to the URL for download of the tab-separated view, e.g.
   <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=%22interpro+IPR014000%22+or+%22interpro+IPR014002%22+or+%22interpro+IPR014003%22&amp;format=tab&amp;columns=id,database(interpro)">
    /uniprot/?query=%22interpro+IPR014000%22+or+%22interpro+IPR014002%22+or+%22interpro+IPR014003%22&amp;format=tab&amp;columns=id,database(interpro)
