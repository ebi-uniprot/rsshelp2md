  This subsection of the 'Sequence' section is used for sequence fragments to indicate that the residue at the extremity of the sequence is not the actual terminal residue in the complete protein sequence.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first residue of the displayed protein sequence may not correspond to the true N-terminus of the complete protein sequence.
  <br/>
  Example:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P29309#sequences">
   P29309
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  The last residue of the displayed protein sequence may not correspond to the true C-terminus of the complete protein sequence.
  <br/>
  Example:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P21215#sequences">
   P21215
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  There is no description field for this subsection. The 'Non-terminal residue' subsection is used for all incomplete protein sequence entries and is accompanied by the 'Fragment' flag in the

  subsection.
