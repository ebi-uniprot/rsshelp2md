  The UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) is the central hub for
    the collection of functional information on proteins, with
    accurate, consistent and rich annotation. In addition to
    capturing the core data mandatory for each UniProtKB entry
    (mainly, the amino acid sequence, protein name or description,
    taxonomic data and citation information), as much annotation
    information as possible is added. This includes widely accepted
    biological ontologies, classifications and cross-references, and
    clear indications of the quality of annotation in the form of
    evidence attribution of experimental and computational data.
 </p>
 <p>
  The UniProt Knowledgebase consists of two sections: a section
    containing manually-annotated records with information extracted
    from literature and curator-evaluated computational analysis, and
    a section with computationally analyzed records that await full
    manual annotation. For the sake of continuity and name recognition,
    the two sections are referred to as "UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot"
    (reviewed, manually annotated) and "UniProtKB/TrEMBL" (unreviewed,
    automatically annotated), respectively.

   Why is UniProtKB composed of 2 sections, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and UniProtKB/TrEMBL?

 <h4>
  Where do the protein sequences come from?
 </h4>
 <p>
  More than 95 % of the protein sequences provided by UniProtKB are derived from the translation of the
    coding sequences (CDS) which have been submitted to the public
    nucleic acid databases, the EMBL-Bank/GenBank/DDBJ databases (
  <a href="http://www.insdc.org/">
   INSDC
  </a>
  ). All these
    sequences, as well as the related data submitted by the authors, are automatically integrated into UniProtKB/TrEMBL.

 <h4>
  What are the differences between UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and UniProtKB/TrEMBL?
 </h4>
 <p>
  UniProtKB/TrEMBL (unreviewed) contains protein sequences
    associated with computationally generated annotation and large-scale
    functional characterization. UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (reviewed) is
    a high quality manually annotated and non-redundant protein
    sequence database, which brings together experimental results,
    computed features and scientific conclusions.
 </p>
 <h4>
  How redundant are sequences in UniProtKB?
 </h4>
 <p>
  In order to have minimal redundancy and to improve sequence
    reliability, all protein sequences encoded by a same gene are
    merged into a single UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry. Differences found
    between various sequencing reports are analysed and fully described
    in the feature table (alternative splicing events, genetic variations
    or conflicts for example). Once in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot,
    a protein entry is removed from UniProtKB/TrEMBL.

 <h4>
  What is manual annotation?
 </h4>
 <p>
  Manual annotation consists of a critical review of experimentally
    proven or computer-predicted data about each protein, including
    the protein sequences. Data are continuously updated by an expert
    team of biologists.

 <h4>
  How are entry versions archived?
 </h4>
 <p>
  All changed UniProtKB entries are loaded into the UniSave Sequence/Annotation
     Version Archive as part of the public four weekly UniProtKB releases.
    Unlike UniProtKB, which contains only the latest Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL entry versions,
    UniSave provides access to previous versions of these entries.
  <br/>
  Archived versions of a UniProtKB entry are accessible through the
  <em>
   Previous versions
  </em>
  link
    located at the bottom of the entry view's left-hand navigation bar.
