  This subsection of the 'Family and domains' section provides general information on the biological role of a domain. The term 'domain' is intended here in its wide acceptation, it may be a structural domain, a transmembrane region or a functional domain. Several domains are described in this subsection.

  The domains described in this subsection are generally also described at the
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/manual/domain">
   sequence level
  </a>
  (cf. 'Domains and Repeats' subsection).

  Example:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q96NN9#family%5Fand%5Fdomains">
   Q96NN9

  This subsection contains also information, such as the location, length and function of domains that have no precise name and that cannot be described at the sequence level.
