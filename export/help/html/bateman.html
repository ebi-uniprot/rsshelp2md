 </h4>
 <p>
  Dr. Alex Bateman joined EMBL-EBI as the Head of Protein Sequence Resources cluster in 2012 and has oversight for world leading protein and ncRNA related databases, namely UniProt, Pfam, Rfam, RNAcentral and InterPro. He took over from Dr. Rolf Apweiler as PI for the UniProt grant. In addition, the work of the Bateman Research Group focuses on the analysis of protein and RNA sequences and understanding how they evolve, function and interact. Prior to that he managed the production of numerous popular biological databases such as Pfam and Rfam at the Sanger Institute. He was formerly a member of, and Chairman of the ISB's Executive Committee. He was also Executive Editor for Bioinformatics and Editor of Nucleic Acids Research's database issue. He recently edited a book on protein families with Christine Orengo.
