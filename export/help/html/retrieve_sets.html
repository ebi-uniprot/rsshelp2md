  UniProtKB entries are available in three file formats - Flat Text, XML and RDF/XML. UniProtKB entries in these formats each contain only one protein sequence, the so-called 'canonical' sequence. UniProtKB canonical sequences are also available in FASTA format, as are additional manually curated isoform sequences that are described in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. Below we describe how these sets can be accessed.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to the predefined FASTA, XML, RDF/XML and text formats, search results can also be downloaded in tab-separated or Excel format, reflecting your own

   Retrieving sequences from the website
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Perform your favorite query and view the resulting list of entries (e.g. this query retrieves all UniProtKB entries that are part of the human proteome:
   <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=proteome:UP000005640">
    proteome:UP000005640
   </a>
   )
  </li>
  <li>
   Click the
   <strong>
    Download
   </strong>
   button in the query result page
  </li>
  <li>
   Choose the desired download format (Flat Text, XML, RDF/XML, tab-delimited, Excel or FASTA if additional isoform sequences are desired)
   <ul>
    <li>
     Choosing
     <code>
      Flat Text
     </code>
     ,
     <code>
      XML
     </code>
     , or
     <code>
      RDF/XML
     </code>
     allows retrieval of all entries (and their canonical sequences) from the result list in the desired format.
    </li>
    <li>
     Choosing
     <code>
      FASTA (canonical) format
     </code>
     allows retrieval of all canonical sequences from the query result list. This can include canonical sequences from both UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and/or UniProtKB/TrEMBL entries.
    </li>
    <li>
     Choosing the option
     <code>
      FASTA (canonical and isoform)
     </code>
     allows retrieval of all canonical sequences plus all manually reviewed isoform sequences described within UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. These manually reviewed isoform sequences are available as distinct sequences in FASTA format only within this expanded downloadable set.
    </li>
    <li>
     Choosing
     <code>
      Tab-separated
     </code>
     or
     <code>
      Excel
     </code>
     allows retrieval of your search result table reflecting the columns you have

   Retrieving sequences from the FTP site

  The UniProt FTP sites (accessible via the

  ) provide the most frequently requested data sets in each of the aforementioned file formats (Flat Text, XML, RDF/XML, FASTA). The additional manually curated isoform sequences that are described in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot are available in a separate FASTA file (
  <code>
   uniprot_sprot_varsplic.fasta.gz
  </code>
  ). Our FTP directory also includes expanded FASTA sets, containing both the canonical and manually reviewed isoform sequences, for all
