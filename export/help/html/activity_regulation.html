  This subsection of the
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/function%5Fsection">
   Function
  </a>
  section describes regulatory mechanisms for enzymes, transporters or microbial transcription factors, and reports the components which regulate (by activation or inhibition) the reaction.
 </p>
 <p>
  Example:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P17289#function">
   P17289
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  A regulation can be allosteric, performed by natural or synthetic products or may be due to a post-translational modification (PTM).

  This subsection describes the regulation at the protein level. We do not describe genetic regulation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Note that the absence of a regulation can also be reported (usually if other members of the family are regulated by a given component).

  This annotation topic used to be called "Enzyme regulation" prior to release 2018_08.
