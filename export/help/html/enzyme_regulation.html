  In UniProtKB entries, the topic 'Enzyme regulation' was used to display information about factors that regulate the activity of enzymes, but also of transporters and microbial transcription factors. To clarify the situation, we have renamed this topic to
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/activity%5Fregulation">
   Activity regulation
