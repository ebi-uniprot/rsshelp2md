  When browsing through different UniProt proteins, you can use the 'basket' to save them, so that you can back to find or analyse them later.
 </p>
 <p>
  The UniProt basket allows you to
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   remember your favorite proteins
  </li>
  <li>
   build your own selection of proteins over time
  </li>
  <li>
   come back to a saved protein later on
  </li>
  <li>
   analyse a subset of your proteins (Align, BLAST, ID mapping, download).
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h3 id="Adding_proteins_to_your_basket">
  Adding proteins to your basket
 </h3>
 <p>
  You can add proteins to your basket
  <strong>
   from search result pages
  </strong>
  for the UniProtKB, UniRef or UniParc datasets. Simply select them in the result table and click on the 'Add to basket' button.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can also add proteins to your basket
  <strong>
   from the protein entry pages
  </strong>
  , using the 'Add to basket' button towards the top of the page.
  <br/>
  Once you add entries to your basket, you will see a small basket icon appear under the entry ID. You will also see the number on the basket changing to show that new proteins have been added.
 </p>
 <h3 id="Using_the_basket">
  Using the basket
 </h3>
 <p>
  Clicking on the basket button will show you your saved proteins.
 </p>
 <p>
  The basket consists of 3 separate tabs, for UniProtKB, UniRef and UniParc entries.
  <br/>
  The basket provides buttons that allow you to select proteins within the basket to align them, run a BLAST search or download them in various formats. You can delete entries one by one from the 'Remove' column or use the 'Clear' button to delete all saved entries from one of the available basket tabs (UniProtKB, UniRef or UniParc).
 </p>
 <p>
  You can also use the 'Full View' button to transfer the entries to a full result page for additional functionality such as filters and customisable columns.
 </p>
 <p>
  The contents of the basket will remain there until you delete your browser's cookies or clear the basket yourself.
