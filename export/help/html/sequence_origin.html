  More than 95% of the protein sequences provided by UniProtKB come from the translations of coding sequences (CDS) submitted to the EMBL-Bank/GenBank/DDBJ nucleotide sequence resources (International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (
  <a href="http://www.insdc.org/">
   INSDC
  </a>
  )). These CDS are either generated by gene prediction programs or are experimentally proven. A protein identifier ("protein_id") is assigned to the translated CDS and can be found in the original EMBL-Bank/GenBank/DDBJ record and in the relevant UniProtKB entry.
 </p>
 <p>
  The translated CDS sequences are automatically transferred to the TrEMBL section of UniProtKB. The TrEMBL records can be selected for further manual annotation and then integrated into the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot section. The "protein_id" are listed in the cross-reference part of the 'Sequence' section, of the UniProtKB entries (see for example
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P13744#sequences">
   P13744
  </a>
  'Translation').

  In addition to translated CDS, UniProtKB protein sequences may come from:

 <ul>
  <li>
   the
   <a href="http://www.wwpdb.org/">
    PDB
   </a>
   database.
  </li>
  <li>
   sequences experimentally obtained by direct protein sequencing, by Edman degradation or MS/MS experiments and
   <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/submissions">
    submitted to UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
   </a>
   . Only about 5% of the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries contain sequence data obtained by direct protein sequencing (

  The FAQ
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/uniprotkb%5Fcoverage">
   Does UniProtKB contain all protein sequences?
  </a>
  gives information on our UniProtKB protein sequence exclusion policies, e.g. for

  .

  (1) Complementary pipelines for import of protein sequences have been developed in collaboration with Ensembl for vertebrate species, Ensembl Genomes for non-vertebrate species, WormBase ParaSite for parasitic nematodes and VectorBase for pathogen vector genomes. In addition, a new pipeline imports selected non-redundant genomes annotated by NCBI RefSeq. These sources provide proteome sequences for a number of key genomes of special interest where the INSDC submission is lacking gene model annotation.
 </p>
 <p>
  To date, these pipeline have been used to populate UniProtKB with additional predicted sequences for the human and mouse proteomes as well as a number of other important vertebrate and non-vertebrate species. See:
