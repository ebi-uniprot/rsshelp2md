  This subsection of the
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/structure%5Fsection">
   'Structure'
  </a>
  section is used to indicate the positions of experimentally determined hydrogen-bonded turns within the protein sequence. These elements correspond to the DSSP secondary structure code 'T'.
 </p>
 <p>
  In UniProtKB the positions of hydrogen-bonded turns are neither predicted by computational means, nor propagated 'By similarity' to related species.
