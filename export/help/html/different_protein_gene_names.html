   Ambiguities regarding gene/protein names are a major
     problem in the literature and in the sequence databases
     which tend to propagate the confusion. As administrators of
     UniProt we feel that we can play a major role in standardization
     of protein nomenclature.
  </p>
  <p>
   We try to attribute a recommended name to all the proteins
     of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, following as far as possible the
   <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/docs/International_Protein_Nomenclature_Guidelines.pdf">
    International protein nomenclature guidelines
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   We have however to be as exhaustive as possible and to also
     list synonym names (alternative names) for a given protein.
     These alternative names are manually added if they are found in
     publication or other databases, including the EMBL database.
     This is essential for protein sequence retrieval and tracking.
  </p>
  <p>
   The protein name always starts with the recommended name of the protein.
     Alternative names are indicated. Example:
   <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P08758#names_and_taxonomy">
    P08758
   </a>
  </p>
  <pre>
Recommended name:  Annexin A5
Alternative names: Anchorin CII
                   Annexin V
                   Annexin-5
                   Calphobindin I
                       Short name: CBP-I
                   Endonexin II
                   Lipocortin V
                   Placental anticoagulant protein 4
                       Short name: PP4
                   Placental anticoagulant protein I
                       Short name: PAP-I
                   Thromboplastin inhibitor
                   Vascular anticoagulant-alpha;
                       Short name: VAC-alpha
</pre>
  <p>
   The format of the protein name in UniProtKB/TrEMBL
     follows closely the format used in
     UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. However, as UniProtKB/TrEMBL
     is not manually annotated, the description is derived directly
     from the underlying nucleotide entry and its accuracy relies
     on the information provided by the submitter of the nucleotide
     entry. It is why UniProtKB/TrEMBL entries usually have 'Submitted name' instead of a 'Recommended name'.
     The description may later be improved by automatic
     annotation procedures but if not, it remains as provided by
     the submitter until the entry is manually annotated and added
     to UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.

   <b>
    Protein isoform name
   </b>
  </p>
  <p>
   Given that for most genes there is no accepted, standardized nomenclature that covers all individual isoforms,
    our policy is to identify them using simple numbering, beginning with isoform 1.

    Example:
   <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q15406#sequences">
    Q15406
   </a>
  </p>
  <p>
   When a comprehensive nomenclature does exist for all isoforms, then this will be applied.
        Example:
   <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P04150#sequences">
    P04150
   </a>
  </p>
  <p>
   In either case all isoform-specific synonyms used in the literature will also be recorded,
     in order to facilitate the identification of specific isoform sequences by users.
     Example:
   <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P08235#sequences">
    P08235
   </a>
  </p>
