  This subsection of the
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/ptm%5Fprocessing%5Fsection">
   PTM / Processing
  </a>
  section describes a propeptide, which is a part of a protein that is cleaved during maturation or activation. Once cleaved, a propeptide generally has no independent biological function.
 </p>
 <p>
  Examples:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P29958#ptm%5Fprocessing">
   P29958
  </a>
  ,

 <p>
  This subsection is only present when the existence of the propeptide has been demonstrated experimentally in the protein concerned or in a closely related homolog.
  <br/>
  Example:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q8WXQ8#ptm%5Fprocessing">
   Q8WXQ8
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  Each propeptide has a
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/sequence%5Fannotation#annotation%5Fid">
   stable identifier
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  We do not annotate the 2 to 4 basic amino acid residues regions produced by basic-specific proconvertase cleavage as a 'Propeptide', since these short oligopeptides are degraded and are generally not considered as bona fide propeptides.
