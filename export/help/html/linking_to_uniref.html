   Are UniRef cluster identifiers permanent?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  No. However, the vast majority do not change from release to release even if clusters are recomputed, and the representative entry usually remains the same. For example,
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniref/UniRef50%5FP99999">
   UniRef50_P99999
  </a>
  has over 450 members, and
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P99999">
   Cytochrome C from Human
  </a>
  is the representative. This will probably remain so, as it is by far the best annotated and biologically relevant member of the cluster. If a cluster has multiple equally suitable well-annotated members, the historically consistent representative member takes precedence.

  <strong>
   How do I link to UniRef clusters, and what if the cluster ID changed?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  You can link directly to UniRef using the cluster ID:
 </p>
 <code>
  https://www.uniprot.org/uniref/UniRef90_P99999
 </code>
 <p>
  A more stable way of referring to the UniRef90 cluster containing
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P99999">
   P99999
  </a>
  , however, is to use query URLs as in this example:
 </p>
 <p>
  Link to the UniRef90 cluster containing UniProtKB P99999:
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniref/?query=member:P99999+AND+identity:0.9">
   member:P99999 AND identity:0.9
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  You can replace
  <code>
   identity:0.9
  </code>
  with
  <code>
   identity:0.5
  </code>
  for UniRef50 or
  <code>
   identity:1.0
  </code>
  for UniRef100.
 </p>
 <p>
  These URLs will continue to work, even if the representative member and thus the cluster ID change between releases.
