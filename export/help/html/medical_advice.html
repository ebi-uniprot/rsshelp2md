  UniProtKB is a protein sequence database and our staff consists of biologists and biochemists that are not trained to give medical advice.
 </p>
 <p>
  UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot contains a limited amount of
  <strong>
   information concerning genetic diseases
  </strong>
  (in the
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/pathology%5Fand%5Fbiotech%5Fsection">
   Pathology and Biotech
  </a>
  section,
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/involvement%5Fin%5Fdisease">
   Involvement in disease
  </a>
  subsection), as well as
  <strong>
   sequence information on some disease-linked variations
  </strong>
  (see
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/sequences%5Fsection">
   Sequence
  </a>
  section, or
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/variant">
   Natural variant
  </a>
  ' under 'Pathology and Biotech').

  Much more information on diseases is available from the

  In case you are interested in a "rare" genetic disease you can look up the
  <a href="http://www.orpha.net/">
   Orphanet website
  </a>
  , which is cross-referenced from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry pages and also has links to disease-specific patient organizations.
