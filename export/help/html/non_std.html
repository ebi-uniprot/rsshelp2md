  This subsection of the 'Sequence' section describes the occurrence of non-standard amino acids selenocysteine (Sec) or pyrrolysine (Pyl) in the protein sequence.
 </p>
 <p>
  Selenocysteine and pyrrolysine are represented in the sequence using the one-letter codes 'U' for selenocysteine and 'O' for pyrrolysine.
 </p>
 <p>
  Incorporation of a selenocysteine or of a pyrrolysine in the protein sequence is due to a stop codon read-through event by which the meaning of the stop codon UGA or UAG, respectively, is redefined during the process of translation.

  This subsection is only present when the incorporation of the non-standard amino acid has been experimentally proven. It can be propagated 'By similarity' to closely related homologs.
 </p>
 <p>
  If a selenocysteine is present in an enzyme where it is part of the active site (as in glutathione peroxidase or iodothyronine deiodinase), then the position is annotated both in the 'Non-standard residue' and '
