  UniProt's Automatic Annotation pipeline enhances the unreviewed records in UniProtKB by enriching them with automatic classification and annotation.

 <h3 id="Automatic_classification_and_domain_annotation">
  Automatic classification and domain annotation
 </h3>
 <p>
  UniProt uses
  <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro">
   InterPro
  </a>
  to classify sequences at superfamily, family and subfamily levels and to predict the occurrence of functional domains and important sites. InterPro integrates predictive models of protein function, so-called 'signatures', from a number of member databases. InterPro matches are automatically annotated to UniProtKB entries as database cross-references with every InterPro release.
 </p>
 <p>
  In UniProtKB/TrEMBL entries,
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/manual/domain">
   domains
  </a>
  from the InterPro member databases PROSITE, SMART or Pfam are predicted and annotated automatically, and their
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/evidences">
   evidence/source
  </a>
  labels indicate "InterPro annotation".

 <h3 id="Automatic_annotation">

 <p>
  UniProt has developed two prediction systems,
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/unirule">
   UniRule
  </a>
  and the
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/arba">
   Association-Rule-Based Annotator (ARBA)
  </a>
  to automatically annotate UniProtKB/TrEMBL in an efficient and scalable manner with a high degree of accuracy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Rules that constitute these two prediction systems can be browsed and queried in dedicated sections of the UniProt website:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/unirule">
    UniRule
   </a>
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/arba">
    ARBA
   </a>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  We also use a suite of
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/sam">
   Sequence Analysis Methods (SAM)
  </a>
  to enrich the unreviewed TrEMBL records in the UniProt Knowledgebase with extra sequence-specific information. Predictions of sequence features such as Signal, Transmembrane and Coil regions are generated using software from external providers.
