     If you are familiar with the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot format we encourage you to submit
        your updates and/or corrections using that format, but this is not a
        prerequisite and we prefer that you provide a longer textual description
        of what you are submitting rather than spend time trying to fit your data to
        our format.

     Whenever you are reporting data relevant to a particular position or
        stretch of residues in a sequence, always use an absolute numbering system
        that starts with the first residue of the sequence in the entry.

     A UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot annotator will mail

     UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot is a curated database and not an unedited archive or repository.
        We are therefore making no promise as to whether we will accept to represent
        in a given entry all data sent to us. But when we do not make use of some
        item of information, we will report back.
