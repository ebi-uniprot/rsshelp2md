  This subsection of the
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/names%5Fand%5Ftaxonomy%5Fsection">
   Names and taxonomy
  </a>
  section indicates if the gene coding for the protein originates from the hydrogenosome, the mitochondrion, the nucleomorph, different plastids or a plasmid. The absence of this section means that the gene is located in one of the main chromosomal element(s).

  6 categories exist for plastids:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   'Chloroplast' indicates the organism is photosynthetic.
  </li>
  <li>
   'Non-photosynthetic plastid' is used when the organism is from a photosynthetic lineage but genetically unable to photosynthesize, as happens with some parasitic plants (Epifagus virginiana, Aneura mirabilis), a parastic "green" algae (Helicosporidium sp. subsp. Simulium jonesii) and a euglenoid (Astasia longa).
  </li>
  <li>
   'Cyanelle' is used for the plastid of the glaucophyte algae. It has the remnants of a cell wall between its surrounding membranes.
  </li>
  <li>
   'Apicoplast' is used for plastids from the non-photosynthetic Apicocomplexan parasites such as Plasmodium, Toxoplasma and Eimeria which cause malaria, toxoplasmosis and coccidian diseases respectively. Although the plastid remnant has a reduced coding capacity it is essential for cell survival, and is interesting as a drug target.
  </li>
  <li>
   'Organellar chromatophore' is used for the plastid of the thecate amoeba Paulinella chromatophora, which has a very large endosymbiont genome (1.0 Mb, encoding almost 900 proteins).
  </li>
  <li>
   'Plastid' (without any qualifier) is used for some parasitic plants (mostly from the genus Cuscuta) which may be briefly photosynthetic when very young.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Being quite small plastids are easily sequenced. A list of fully sequenced plastid genomes, of their genes and the nomenclature of known plastid-encoded proteins can be found in the document
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/docs/plastid">
   Nomenclature of plastid-encoded proteins
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  If an entry reports the sequence of a protein encoded on a number of plasmids, the names of all plasmids are listed.
