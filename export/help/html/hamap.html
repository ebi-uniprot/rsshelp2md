  HAMAP is a system, based on manually curated family profiles and associated annotation rules, which identifies and automatically annotates proteins that are part of well-conserved families or subfamilies.
 </p>
 <p>
  UniProtKB/TrEMBL sequences that match one of the HAMAP profiles are annotated using the associated annotation rule. The results of this annotation are integrated into UniProtKB/TrEMBL.
