  This subsection of the 'Expression' section provides information on the expression of a gene at the mRNA or protein level in cells or in tissues of multicellular organisms. By default, the information is derived from experiments at the mRNA level, unless specified 'at protein level'.
  <br/>
  Examples:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P92958#expression">
   P92958
  </a>
  ,
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q8TDN4#expression">
   Q8TDN4
  </a>
  ,
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/O14734#expression">
   O14734
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  The documented absence of a given gene product in a tissue is also indicated.
  <br/>
  Example:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q8K3X6#expression">
   Q8K3X6
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  If information about the tissue expression is inconsistent between two different references, the contradictory results are described and references are provided for each statement.
  <br/>
  Example:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q8TAA9#expression">
   Q8TAA9

   Under 'Tissue specificity', we manually capture knowledge from the literature regarding the expression of the protein or its mRNA. In the literature, data concerning the expression of a protein in an organisms' tissues is quite often partial, controversial and more generally qualitative and not quantitative. Moreover, expert curation being a manual process, it also happens that knowledge for a given protein is not up-to-date. For these reasons, the tissues listed in this subsection, frequently correspond to those where expression has been reported in manually curated publications. They do not necessarily indicate how
   <strong>
    specific
   </strong>
   the expression is to this tissues. We try as much as possible to indicate expression specificity by using the following terms: "ubiquitously expressed...", "widely expressed..." or "tissue x-specific... ", when a consensus exists among the publications, but the information does remain qualitative. To obtain comprehensive and quantitative expression data, we suggest to consult specialized resources such as those listed in the 'Gene expression databases' section of our cross-references section (Example:
   <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P49759#expression">
    P49759
   </a>
   ).
