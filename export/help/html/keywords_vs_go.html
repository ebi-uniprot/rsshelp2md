   UniProtKB keywords are controlled vocabulary developed according to the
                need and content of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries. They provide a summary
       of the entry content and are used to index entries based on
   <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/">
    10 categories
   </a>
   .
                Each keyword is attributed manually to UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries and automatically to
       UniProtKB/TrEMBL entries (according to specific annotation rules).

  <p>
   The Gene Ontology project (
   <a href="http://www.geneontology.org/">
    GO
   </a>
   ) provides a
                controlled vocabulary to describe gene and gene product attributes in any
                organism. This controlled vocabulary is developed independently of any
                existing databases. There are 3 disjoint categories: cellular component,
                molecular function and biological process. An important task is to
                map the GO terms with the gene and gene products and introduce them into
       databases via automatic (electronic) or manual annotation.
  </p>
  <p>
   In UniProtKB, GO terms are manually mapped to keywords, EC number,
                InterPro matches or HAMAP family rules and only then transferred
                automatically to the entries. Direct GO annotation in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
       entries is entirely manual.
