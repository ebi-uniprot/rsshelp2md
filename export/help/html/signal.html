  This subsection of the 'PTM / Processing' section denotes the presence of an N-terminal signal peptide.
 </p>
 <p>
  Signal peptides are found in proteins that are targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum and eventually destined to be either secreted/extracellular/periplasmic/etc., retained in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, of the lysosome or of any other organelle along the secretory pathway or to be I single-pass membrane proteins.
 </p>
 <p>
  The signal sequence is usually removed in the mature protein; in these cases, the comment 'The displayed sequence is further processed into a mature form' is added in the '
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/manual/sequences_section">

  ' section.

  1. Annotation of experimentally proven signal peptides
 </h3>
 <p>
  We annotate experimentally proven signal peptides when the cleavage site has been determined by direct protein sequencing.
  <br/>
  Example:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P01165#ptm_processing">
   P01165
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  This information can then be propagated
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/evidences#ECO:0000250">
   'By similarity'
  </a>
  to closely related species providing the signal sequence is conserved.
  <br/>
  Example:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q8CW46#ptm_processing">
   Q8CW46
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  When it is clear that a protein is cleaved (according to experimental data or its similarity with a family of proteins), but direct protein sequencing has not been used to determined the precise cleavage position, we use a question mark instead of a position.
  <br/>
  Example:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9VGW1#ptm_processing">
   Q9VGW1
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  In some rare cases, signal sequences are not cleaved. This is indicated by the note 'Not cleaved' in the feature description.
  <br/>
  Example:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/O95445#ptm_processing">
   O95445
  </a>

 <h3 id="2__Annotation_of_predicted_signal_peptides">
  2. Annotation of predicted signal peptides
 </h3>
 <p>
  We annotate signal peptides which are predicted by the application of the predictive tools Phobius, Predotar, SignalP and TargetP. At least two methods must return a positive signal peptide prediction in order for the prediction to be annotated in UniProtKB. When predicted N-terminal signal peptides and transmembrane regions overlap, then the prediction returned by Phobius is used to discriminate between the two possibilities.
  <br/>
  Example:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q6Q788#ptm_processing">
   Q6Q788
  </a>

 <h3 id="3__Annotation_of_Tat_signal_sequences_in_bacteria_and_archaea">
  3. Annotation of Tat signal sequences in bacteria and archaea
 </h3>
 <p>
  This subsection is also used for the annotation of proteins with a Tat (Twin-arginine translocation) signal sequence, which serves to translocate folded proteins in bacteria and archaea. Substrate proteins are directed to the Tat apparatus by distinctive N-terminal signal peptides containing a consensus SRRxFLK 'twin-arginine' motif. The related comment "Predicted to be exported by the Tat system" can be found in the 'Post-translational modification' subsection.
  <br/>
  Example:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P36649#ptm%5Fprocessing">
   P36649
  </a>
  <br/>
  Predicted TAT signal sequences are identified using the PROSITE profile
  <a href="https://prosite.expasy.org/PS51318">
   PS51318
  </a>
  .
  <br/>
  Predicted cleavage sites are tagged with evidence
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/evidences#ECO:0000255">
   'Sequence analysis'
  </a>
  or with the
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/automatic%5Fannotation">
   automatic annotation
  </a>
  rule from which the predicted result was propagated.
  <br/>
  Example:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P36649#ptm_processing">
   P36649
  </a>

 <p>
  In
  <strong>
   UniProtKB/TrEMBL
  </strong>
  , signal peptides are annotated automatically by our
