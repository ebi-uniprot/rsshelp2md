  This subsection of the
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/sequences%5Fsection">
   Sequence
  </a>
  section indicates if the
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/canonical%5Fand%5Fisoforms">
   canonical sequence
  </a>
  displayed by default in the entry is in its mature form or if it represents the precursor.
 </p>
 <h3 id="The_canonical_sequence_is_a_precursor">
  The canonical sequence is a precursor
 </h3>
 <p>
  If the canonical sequence requires processing to become mature, the following comment is found in the 'Sequence processing' subsection: 'The displayed sequence is further processed into a mature form.'
  <br/>
  Example:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P01308#sequences">
   P01308
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  Processing of the precursor includes signal peptide and propeptide cleavage, transit peptide cleavage or initiator methionine cleavage. The processing required for maturation is described in the
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/ptm%5Fprocessing%5Fsection">
   PTM / Processing
  </a>
  section.
  <br/>
  Examples:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P01308#ptm%5Fprocessing">
   P01308

 <p>
  If there is no evidence for further processing (e.g. the canonical sequence represents the mature form), there is no 'Sequence processing' subsection.
  <br/>
  Example:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/O60437#sequences">
   O60437
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  Remark: There is also no 'Sequence processing' subsection if the canonical sequence is not yet known to require further processing.
