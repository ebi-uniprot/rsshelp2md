  7-transmembrane G-linked receptors
 </h3>
 <p>
  7-transmembrane G-linked receptors (also known as G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), seven-transmembrane domain receptors, 7TM receptors, heptahelical receptors, serpentine receptor and G protein-linked receptors (GPLR)) constitute a large protein family of receptors that sense molecules outside the cell and activate inside signal transduction pathways and cellular responses.

  Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases
 </h3>
 <p>
  Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are enzymes that activate an amino acid for translation by forming an aminoacyladenylate intermediate and then link this activated amino acid to the corresponding tRNA molecule. In general, a specific aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase is available for the 20 amino acids.

 <p>
  Protein splicing is defined as the excision of an intervening protein sequence (the intein) from a protein precursor and the concomitant ligation of the flanking protein fragments (the exteins) to form a mature extein protein and the free intein. Protein splicing results in a native peptide bond between the ligated exteins.
