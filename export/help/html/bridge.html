  Short biography

 <p>
  Dr. Alan Bridge joined the Swiss-Prot group at the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics in Geneva in 2004 where he worked as a biocurator and in the Quality Assurance Department. In 2008 he became jointly responsible for the curated content of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and coordination of these activities with EMBL-EBI and PIR colleagues, and in 2009, was made head of the Department of Automation and Enhancements. Dr. Bridge was appointed as the Director of the Swiss-Prot group in 2018 and is responsible for all aspects of the group's work, including resource development, training and outreach, and coordination with its international partners. The Swiss-Prot group develops and maintains a number of internationally renowned resources including UniProt, a resource of protein sequences and functional annotation (with partners EMBL-EBI and PIR), the
