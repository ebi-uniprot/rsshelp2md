  A pan proteome is the full set of proteins thought to be expressed by a group of highly related organisms (e.g. multiple strains of the same bacterial species).
 </p>
 <p>
  Pan proteomes provide a representative set of all the sequences within a taxonomic group and capture unique sequences not found in the group's
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/reference%5Fproteome">
   reference proteome
  </a>
  . UniProtKB pan proteomes encompass all non-redundant proteomes and are aimed at users interested in phylogenetic comparisons and the study of genome evolution and gene diversity.

 <p>
  When a proteome has proteins that are part of a larger pan proteome, you will see it indicated on the proteome page in the 'Pan proteome' row. You will also see a link to download the full fasta sequence set, e.g.

   Bacillus subtilis 168
  </a>
  .

  Pan proteome sets can be downloaded from the UniProt FTP site through the
