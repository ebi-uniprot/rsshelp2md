  The web address for an entry consists of a data set name (e.g.
  <code>
   uniprot
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
   uniref
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
   uniparc
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
   taxonomy
  </code>
  , ...) and the entry's unique identifier, e.g.:
 </p>
 <pre>https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P12345</pre>
 <p>
  By default, a web page is returned. Depending on the data set, other formats may also be available (click on "Formats" on the entry's web page). Here are some examples:
 </p>
 <pre>https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P12345.txt
https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P12345.xml

  Note that UniRef identifiers cannot be guaranteed to be stable, since the sequence clusters are recomputed at every release, and the representative protein may change. See also:

  For the RDF/XML format there is an option to include data from referenced data sets directly in the returned data:
 </p>
 <pre>https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P12345.rdf?include=yes </pre>
 <p>
  The following
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html">
   status codes
  </a>
  may be returned:

  <tr>

  A request for an address such as
 </p>
 <pre>http://purl.uniprot.org/uniprot/P12345</pre>
 <p>
  will be resolved, where possible, by redirection to the corresponding resource (see previous section). For UniProt resources, entries are returned in RDF/XML format if the HTTP
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html">
   <code>
    'Accept'
   </code>
   request header

  is set to
