  If you are accessing UniProt programmatically, using our
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/api">
   REST API
  </a>
  , and are just interested in the number of entries returned by your query, but not in downloading or listing all the hits, you can check the
  <code>
   X-Total-Results
  </code>
  header like in the PERL code example
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/programmatic%5Faccess#downloading">
   Download all UniProt sequences for a given organism in FASTA format
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  This returns the entry count, allowing you to count the hits without actually retrieving them.
