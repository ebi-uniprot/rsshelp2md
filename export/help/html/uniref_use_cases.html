  UniRef is not limited to similarity searches only. The fact that UniRef representatives are distinct and members are consistent allows more extensive uses.

  A few examples are:

  UniRef can help with functional annotation and gene prediction. In particular UniRef90/50 clusters provide common Gene Ontology annotation that is consistent within the members and can be used directly for prediction. See:

  UniRef is also being used for functional profiling, enrichment and gene analysis. It has become a common pipeline in metagenomics study, particularly with the tool HUMAnN2. See:

  UniRef databases have been used in machine learning studies, such as building Markov models or serving as training or validation datasets. See:

  Other webservices and software take advantage of the member consistency of UniRef clusters to enhance their databases and tools. For example, the Structure Integration with Function, Taxonomy and Sequences resource (
  <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/docs/sifts/">
   SIFTS
  </a>
  ) now includes mappings to UniRef90 cluster members, expanding its applicability of structures from 44,000 to nearly two million UniProtKB records. See

  The Enzyme Similarity Tool (EFI-EST) for sequence similarity networks now supports functional profiling using UniRef90. See
