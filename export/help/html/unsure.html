  This subsection of the 'Sequences' section is used to describe region(s) of a sequence for which the authors are unsure about the sequence assignment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Example:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P56576#sequences">
   P56576
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  When a protein belongs to a family, we display the most frequent amino acid found at that position in other family members. This is indicated in the 'description' field.

  Example:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P00279#sequences">
   P00279
  </a>
