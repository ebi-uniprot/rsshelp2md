  <strong>
   seed
  </strong>
  is the sequence that has been used as the template to recruit other sequences by the clustering algorithm. The seed sequence is the longest member of a cluster.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the longest sequence is not always the most informative one. There is often more biologically relevant information (name, function, cross-references) available on other cluster members. All the proteins in a cluster are therefore ranked as follows to select the most biologically relevant
  <strong>
   representative sequence
  </strong>
  for the cluster:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Quality of the entry:
   <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/manual%5Fcuration">
    manually reviewed entries
   </a>
   (i.e. from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot) are preferred;
  </li>
  <li>
   Annotation score: entries that have higher UniProtKB
   <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/annotation%5Fscore">
    annotation scores
   </a>
   are preferred. This also means that UniProtKB entries will always take precedence over entries that are in
   <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/uniparc">
    UniParc
   </a>
   but not in UniProtKB;
  </li>
  <li>
   Organism: entries from
   <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/reference%5Fproteome">
    reference proteomes
   </a>
   and model organisms are preferred; and,
  </li>
  <li>
   Length of the sequence: longest sequence is preferred.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  Notes:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The cluster is defined by the identity relationship of its members to the seed,
   <strong>
    not
   </strong>
   to the representative sequence. This does not imply that all sequences within a cluster have the same identity percentage among themselves.
  </li>
  <li>
   In some rare cases, a member is more similar to the representative of another cluster than to the representative of its own cluster, but never more similar to any other clusterâ€™s seed.
  </li>
 </ul>
