  A UniRef cluster is a set of UniProtKB plus selected UniParc sequences that have a specific minimum percent of sequence identity, and a minimum of 80% overlap with the longest sequence (a.k.a.
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/uniref%5Fseed">
   seed sequence
  </a>
  ) of the cluster. One exception to the 80% rule is UniRef100 where identical substrings of 11 or more amino acids are merged.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, UniRef50 contains sequences clusters where all members are at least 50% identical to the seed sequence. Each cluster indicates:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   the seed sequence (longest sequence),
  </li>
  <li>
   the representative sequence (biologically relevant, best annotated, sequence),
  </li>
  <li>
   the list of accessions for the member proteins,
  </li>
  <li>
   cross-references to UniRef clusters (at the 2 other levels of identity) containing the representative sequence,
  </li>
  <li>
   the lowest common taxonomy of all members, and
  </li>
  <li>
   common Gene Ontology terms, if any.
  </li>
 </ul>
