This subsection of the 'Sequence' section describes the occurrence of non-standard amino acids selenocysteine (Sec) or pyrrolysine (Pyl) in the protein sequence.

Selenocysteine and pyrrolysine are represented in the sequence using the one-letter codes 'U' for selenocysteine and 'O' for pyrrolysine.

Incorporation of a selenocysteine or of a pyrrolysine in the protein sequence is due to a stop codon read-through event by which the meaning of the stop codon UGA or UAG, respectively, is redefined during the process of translation.  
  
Examples: [P24183](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P24183) (selenocysteine), [Q8TTA5](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q8TTA5) (pyrrolysine).

This subsection is only present when the incorporation of the non-standard amino acid has been experimentally proven. It can be propagated 'By similarity' to closely related homologs.

If a selenocysteine is present in an enzyme where it is part of the active site (as in glutathione peroxidase or iodothyronine deiodinase), then the position is annotated both in the 'Non-standard residue' and '[Active site](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/act_site)' subsections of the [Function](http://www.uniprot.org/help/function%5Fsection) section.  
  
Example: [P07203](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P07203)
