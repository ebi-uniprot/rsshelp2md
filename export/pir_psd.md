To avoid duplication of work within UniProtKB, PIR-PSD ceased to be maintained as of release 80.00 (31-Dec-2004).

All suitable sequences in PIR-PSD that were missing from Swiss-Prot + TrEMBL at that time were incorporated into the TrEMBL section of UniProtKB. Moreover, all valid references and experimentally verified data - present in PIR-PSD, but missing from Swiss-Prot + TrEMBL- were also transferred to the relevant UniProtKB records.

All PIR-PSD data were imported into [UniParc](http://www.uniprot.org/help/uniparc), and bi-directional cross-references between UniProtKB (Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL) and PIR-PSD were created to allow easy tracking of former PIR-PSD entries.

You can access the archived version of PIR-PSD entries via UniProtKB cross-references to PIR-PSD.
