 The Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Ortholog (BUSCO) assessment tool is used, for eukaryotic and bacterial proteomes, to provide quantitative measures of UniProt proteome data completeness in terms of expected gene content. BUSCO scores include percentages of complete (C) single-copy (S) genes, complete (C) duplicated (D) genes, fragmented (F) and missing (M) genes, as well as the total number of orthologous clusters (n) used in the BUSCO assessment, and the name of the taxonomic lineage dataset used.
