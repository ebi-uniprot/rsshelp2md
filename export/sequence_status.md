This subsection of the [Sequence](http://www.uniprot.org/help/sequences%5Fsection) section indicates if the [canonical sequence](http://www.uniprot.org/help/canonical%5Fand%5Fisoforms) displayed by default in the entry is complete or not.

- If the sequence is complete, the term 'Complete' is used.



Example:[Q04826](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q04826#sequences)

- If the sequence is a fragment, the term 'Fragment' is used.



Example:[P29306](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P29306#sequences)

- If the sequence is composed of several fragments, the term 'Fragments' is used (see for instance:[P0C2W2](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P0C2W2#sequences)). In the ['Sequences'](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/sequences) section, the missing amino acids are either replaced by the letter 'X' (see for instance: [P0C2W2](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P0C2W2#sequences)) or the missing amino acids are not represented. In this case, the non-adjacent amino acids are annotated in the ['Non-adjacent residue'](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/non%5Fcons) subsection of the 'Sequences' section (see for instance: [P68251](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P68251#sequences)).

To exclude fragments from your query results, you can add the search term `fragment:no` to your query.
