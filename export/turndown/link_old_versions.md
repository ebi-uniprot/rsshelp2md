title: How do I link to a specific version of a UniProtKB entry?
categories: UniProtKB,Technical,Release,faq

In order to keep up-to-date with scientific knowledge, we update entries thus producing a new version of the entry each time. For example, there have been over 150 updates to [P00750](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P00750) (TPA\_HUMAN).

The version number appears below the accession number right at the top of a UniProtKB entry view. The **History** link allows you to browse and compare various versions of the entry.

To link to a particular version of an entry, use the **version** parameter in the link, e.g. to link to version 109 of P00750 use:

[https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P00750.txt?version=109](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P00750.txt?version=109)
