UniProt's policy with internet browser support is to support all major browsers up to the oldest version that is also supported by the vendor.

We recommend to use one of the following major web browsers for the UniProt website:

*   FireFox: [Choosing a Firefox update channel](https://support.mozilla.org/en%2DUS/kb/choosing%2Dfirefox%2Dupdate%2Dchannel)
*   Chrome: [Latest stable release](https://www.chromestatus.com/features/schedule)
*   Safari: Look for "Safari" in [Apple security updates](https://support.apple.com/en%2Dus/HT201222)
*   Edge: [Microsoft Edge release notes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en%2Dus/deployedge/microsoft%2Dedge%2Drelnote%2Dstable%2Dchannel)

We currently also support Internet Explorer. A small and constantly decreasing proportion of our users is using Internet Explorer, and we may therefore phase out support for this browser. See [Lifecycle FAQ - Internet Explorer and Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/en%2Dus/lifecycle/faq/internet%2Dexplorer%2Dmicrosoft%2Dedge).

Please note that for older versions of these browsers certain features of the website may not be available (you can check [here](https://whatismybrowser.org/) which browser version you are using).
