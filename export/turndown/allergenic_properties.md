This subsection of the ['Pathology and Biotech'](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/pathology%5Fand%5Fbiotech%5Fsection) section is used for proteins that cause an allergic reaction in mammals. We usually specify in which species the protein is allergenic.

Example: [Q06811](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q06811#pathology_and_biotech)

There is however an exception for an enzyme that does not cause allergic reaction by itself, but catalyzes a modification responsible for multiple allergies in human.  
  
Example: [P45669](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P45669#pathology%5Fand%5Fbiotech)
