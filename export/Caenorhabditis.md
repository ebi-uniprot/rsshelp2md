The Caenorhabditis protein annotation project focuses on the manual annotation of _C. elegans_ and _C. briggsae_ proteins.

See: [How do we manually annotate a UniProtKB entry?](http://www.uniprot.org/faq/45)

UniProtKB works closely both with the worm research community and with [WormBase](http://www.wormbase.org/), the database of the biology and genome of _C. elegans_ and related nematode species, to ensure that UniProtKB data remains complete and up-to-date. The focus in the nematode research community is on the characterisation of _C. elegans_ proteins. This means that there is more literature available for this species which explains the more detailed annotation available in UniProtKB. The majority of _C. briggsae_ proteins are uncharacterised and the annotation in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot for these uncharacterised proteins is propagated from the _C. elegans_ orthologs.

## About Caenorhabditis

The nematode worm, _Caenorhabditis elegans_, is a free-living, transparent roundworm, approximately 1mm in length, which lives in temperate soil environments. It is used extensively as a model organism due to its small size, short life cycle, its transparent body which allows the observation of various processes in the intact organism and the ease with which specific genes can be disrupted, giving an insight into gene and protein function. The developmental origin of each cell in the adult has been precisely mapped - facilitating developmental and cell fate studies. The process of RNA interference was discovered in C.elegans by Fire and Mellor, who subsequently received the Nobel prize for their efforts. It was the first multicellular organism to have its genome sequenced. The sequence was published in 1998, providing an impetus for gene and protein prediction and annotation. In 2003, the genome sequence of the related nematode _Caenorhabditis briggsae_ was also determined, facilitating comparative genomics studies between these two organisms. Three more _Caenorhabditis_ species, _C. brennari_, _C. japonica_ and _C. remanei_, are currently being sequenced. As advances in sequencing technology make genome sequencing faster and cheaper, the genomes of additional nematode species are expected.
