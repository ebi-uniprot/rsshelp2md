This subsection of the 'Family and Domains' section describes a region of interest that cannot be described in other subsections.

It may be used to describe characteristics of a region that have been experimentally defined, such as the role of a region in mediating protein-protein interactions or some other biological process, to describe the different regions in multifunctional enzymes or fusion proteins, or to fully describe the characteristics of a region containing repeats.
