This subsection of the 'Expression' section provides information on the expression of the gene product at various stages of a cell, tissue or organism development. By default, the information is derived from experiments at the mRNA level, unless specified 'at the protein level'.

Examples: [Q925Q8](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q925Q8#expression), [P33124](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P33124#expression), [Q96EP1](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q96EP1#expression)

_Note_: The content of the 'Developmental stage' subsection may overlap with that of the ['Tissue specificity'](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/tissue%5Fspecificity) subsection.
