title: Subcellular location
categories: Subcellular_location,manual
---

This subsection provides information on the location and the topology of the mature protein in the cell.

The information contained in this subsection uses a structured hierarchy of [controlled vocabulary](http://www.uniprot.org/locations), except for the 'Note' which allows free text.  
  
Example: [Q9ULX6](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9ULX6#subcellular%5Flocation)

The whole ontology is described, if known. If different locations coexist, they are listed in this subsection and separated by a period.  
  
Example: [Q02630](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q02630#subcellular%5Flocation), [P38182](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P38182#subcellular%5Flocation)

The subcellular location generally concerns the mature protein. When specific alternative products (isoforms or derived peptides for example) have a specific location, that is clearly indicated.  
  
Example: [O43687](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/O43687#subcellular_location)
