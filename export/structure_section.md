This section provides information on the tertiary and secondary structure of a protein.

The information is filed in different subsections. The current subsections and their content are listed below:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Subsection** | **Content** |
| [Turn](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/turn) | Turns within the experimentally determined protein structure |
| [Beta strand](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/strand) | Beta strand regions within the experimentally determined protein structure |
| [Helix](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/helix) | Helical regions within the experimentally determined protein structure |
| [3D structure databases](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/cross_references_section) | Cross-references that point to data collections other than UniProtKB (i.e. PDB) |
