| ![](http://www.uniprot.org/images/spin.png)[**Submit protein sequences**](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/swissprot/Submissions/spin/) <br>obtained by direct protein sequencing (see also [Do you have a protein to share with the world? - UniProt blog](http://insideuniprot.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/do-you-have-protein-to-share-with-world.html)). |
| ![](http://www.uniprot.org/images/webin.png)[**Submit nucleotide sequences**](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/Submission/webin.html) <br>the translations of these sequences will be entered into UniProtKB automatically (see also [What is the synchronization delay with other databases?](http://www.uniprot.org/help/synchronization)). |

#### Guidelines for submitting updates or corrections to UniProtKB data.

| What to send? | We are grateful for **any feedback**, but welcome especially:<br> › sequence updates<br> › post-translational modifications<br> › confirmation at the protein level of part of a DNA translated sequence<br> › functional information<br> › presence of specific domains in the sequence<br> › alternative names for the protein or the gene coding for it<br> › subunit structure<br> › mass-spectrometry data<br> › strain name |
| What format? | If you are familiar with the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot format we encourage you to submit<br> your updates and/or corrections using that format, but this is not a<br> prerequisite and we prefer that you provide a longer textual description<br> of what you are submitting rather than spend time trying to fit your data to<br> our format. |
| Whose work? | When reporting:<br> › _published information_: please provide the complete reference<br> (authors lists with initials, journal, volume, page range and year) or a PubMed identifier<br> › _unpublished information_: please provide the name of the people<br> associated with a particular item of information<br>Note that you don't have to be the original author to submit us updates, and can therefore report anybody's work. |
| What sequence position? | Whenever you are reporting data relevant to a particular position or<br> stretch of residues in a sequence, always use an absolute numbering system<br> that starts with the first residue of the sequence in the entry. |
| What next? | A UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot annotator will mail<br> the revised sequence entry back to you. Any further comments can be sent<br> directly to that annotator. |
| Where is my data? | UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot is a curated database and not an unedited archive or repository.<br> We are therefore making no promise as to whether we will accept to represent<br> in a given entry all data sent to us. But when we do not make use of some<br> item of information, we will report back. |
