#### Short biography

Dr. Alan Bridge joined the Swiss-Prot group at the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics in Geneva in 2004 where he worked as a biocurator and in the Quality Assurance Department. In 2008 he became jointly responsible for the curated content of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and coordination of these activities with EMBL-EBI and PIR colleagues, and in 2009, was made head of the Department of Automation and Enhancements. Dr. Bridge was appointed as the new Director of the Swiss-Prot group in 2018 and is responsible for all aspects of the group's work, including resource development, training and outreach, and coordination with its international partners. The Swiss-Prot group develops and maintains a number of internationally renowned resources including UniProt, a resource of protein sequences and functional annotation (with partners EMBL-EBI and PIR), the PROSITE and HAMAP resources for protein classification and annotation, the ENZYME resource for enzyme nomenclature, the Rhea resource of biochemical reactions, and the ViralZone resource of viral biology.

#### Group

The [Swiss-Prot group](https://www.sib.swiss/alan%2Dbridge%2Dgroup) develops, annotates and maintains the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot protein sequence database, and also other databases including PROSITE, a database of protein families and domains, and ENZYME, a database of enzyme nomenclature. The group also co-heads the development and maintenance of the ExPASy proteomics website, a life sciences portal which serves as an entry point to several databases and to various online bioinformatics tools.
