This section displays by default the canonical protein sequence and upon request all isoforms described in the entry. It also includes information pertinent to the sequence(s), including [length](http://www.uniprot.org/help/sequence%5Flength) and [molecular weight](http://www.uniprot.org/help/sequences). The information is filed in different subsections. The current subsections and their content are listed below:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Subsection** | **Content** |
| [Sequence status](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/sequence%5Fstatus) | Indicates if the protein sequence is complete or not |
| [Sequence processing](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/sequence%5Fprocessing) | Indicates if the mature form of a protein is derived by processing of a precursor |
| [Sequence](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/sequences) | Canonical protein sequence data and list of described protein isoforms |
| [Alternative products](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/alternative%5Fproducts) | Description of the different proteins generated from the same gene |
| [Computationally mapped potential isoform sequences](http://www.uniprot.org/help/gene%5Fcentric%5Fisoform%5Fmapping) | Automatic gene-centric isoform mapping for eukaryotic reference proteome sequences |
| [Sequence caution](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/sequence%5Fcaution) | Warning about possible errors related to the protein sequence |
| [RNA editing](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/rna%5Fediting) | Description of amino acid change(s) due to RNA editing |
| [Mass spectrometry](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/mass%5Fspectrometry) | Information derived from mass spectrometry experiments |
| [Polymorphism](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/polymorphism) | Description of polymorphism(s) |
| [Natural variant](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/variant) | Description of a natural variant of the protein |
| [Alternative sequence](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/var%5Fseq) | Amino acid change(s) producing alternate protein isoforms |
| [Sequence uncertainty](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/unsure) | Regions of uncertainty in the sequence |
| [Sequence conflict](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/conflict) | Description of sequence discrepancies of unknown origin |
| [Non-adjacent residues](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/non%5Fcons) | Indicates that two residues in a sequence are not consecutive |
| [Non-terminal residue](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/non%5Fter) | The sequence is incomplete. Indicate that a residue is not the terminal residue of the complete protein |
| [Non-standard residue](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/non%5Fstd) | Occurence of non-standard amino acids (selenocysteine and pyrrolysine) in the protein sequence |
| [Sequence databases](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/cross%5Freferences%5Fsection) | Selection of cross-references that point to data collections other than UniProtKB |
| [Genome annotation databases](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/cross%5Freferences%5Fsection) | Selection of cross-references that point to data collections other than UniProtKB |
| [Polymorphism databases](http://www.uniprot.org/manual/cross%5Freferences%5Fsection) | Selection of cross-references that point to data collections other than UniProtKB |
| [Keywords 'Coding sequence diversity'](http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/KW%2D9997) | Selection of controlled vocabulary which summarises the content of an entry |
