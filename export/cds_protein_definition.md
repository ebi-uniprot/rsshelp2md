**What are the criteria for defining a CDS as a real protein, i.e. for inclusion in UniProtKB?**

Most protein sequences are derived from translations of CoDing Sequence
(CDS) derived from gene predictions. A CoDing Sequence (CDS) is a region
of DNA or RNA whose sequence determines the sequence of amino acids in a
protein. It should not be mixed up with an Open Reading Frame (ORF), which
is a series of DNA codons that does not contain any STOP codons. All CDS
are ORFs, but not all ORFs are CDS...

Some of the predicted CDSs exhibit strong sequence similarity to known
proteins in closely related species. For other proteins there is
experimental evidence, such as Edman sequencing, clear identification by
mass spectrometry (MSI), X-ray or NMR structure, detection by antibodies,
etc. However, for some other proteins, there is no evidence at all. To
indicate these different levels of evidence for the existence of a
protein, we have introduced the PE (Protein Existence) line
(see [the protein existence criteria](http://www.uniprot.org/docs/pe_criteria)).

Note that the PE line does not describe the accuracy or correctness of a
sequence displayed in UniProtKB, but the evidence for the existence of a
protein. It may happen that the protein sequence is not entirely accurate,
especially for sequences derived from gene predictions from genomic
sequences.

**What are UniProtKB's criteria for defining a CDS as 'not a real protein'?**

Gene prediction performance largely depends on current biological
knowledge. We use bioinformatics tools to align the proposed CDS with the
latest version of nucleic acid sequences (genomic and RNA/ESTs). We sometimes
suggest that proposed CDS or ORFs are incorrectly predicted protein sequences.
Our evidence can include the presence of new longer or shorter RNAs (fused or
split predicted gene(s)), absence of RNA (even in other species), and/or wrong
intron/exon boundaries (in Eukaryota). Some other protein sequences may have been
identified as pseudogenes in the literature. When there is enough evidence
that these CDSs are not real proteins, we remove them from UniProtKB.
