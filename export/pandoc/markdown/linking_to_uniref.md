**Are UniRef cluster identifiers permanent?**

No.Â However, the vast majority do not change from release to release even if clusters are recomputed, and the representative entry usually remains the same. For example, [UniRef50_P99999](http://www.uniprot.org/uniref/UniRef50%5FP99999) has over 450 members, and [Cytochrome C from Human](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P99999) is the representative. This will probably remain so, as it is by far the best annotated and biologically relevant member of the cluster. If a cluster has multiple equally suitable well-annotated members, the historically consistent representative member takes precedence.

**How do I link to UniRef clusters, and what if the cluster ID changed?**

You can link directly to UniRef using the cluster ID:

`https://www.uniprot.org/uniref/UniRef90_P99999`

A more stable way of referring to the UniRef90 cluster containing [P99999](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P99999) , however, is to use query URLs as in this example:

Link to the UniRef90 cluster containing UniProtKB P99999:

[member:P99999 AND identity:0.9](http://www.uniprot.org/uniref/?query=member:P99999+AND+identity:0.9)

You can replace `identity:0.9` with `identity:0.5` for UniRef50 or `identity:1.0` for UniRef100.

These URLs will continue to work, even if the representative member and thus the cluster ID change between releases.
