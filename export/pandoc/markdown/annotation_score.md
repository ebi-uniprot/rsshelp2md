The annotation score provides a heuristic measure of the annotation content of a UniProtKB entry or proteome. This score **cannot** be used as a measure of the accuracy of the annotation as we cannot define the 'correct annotation' for any given protein.

The annotation score is computed in the following way:

-   Different UniProtKB annotation types (e.g.Â [protein names](http://www.uniprot.org/help/protein%5Fnames) , [gene names](http://www.uniprot.org/help/gene%5Fname) , [functional annotations (comments)](http://www.uniprot.org/help/general%5Fannotation) and [sequence annotations (features)](http://www.uniprot.org/help/sequence%5Fannotation) , [GO annotations](http://www.uniprot.org/help/gene%5Fontology) , [cross-references](http://www.uniprot.org/help/cross%5Freferences%5Fsection) ) are scored either by presence or by number of occurrences. Annotations with experimental [evidence](http://www.uniprot.org/help/evidences) score higher than equivalent predicted/inferred annotations, thereby favoring expert [literature-based curation](http://www.uniprot.org/help/biocuration) over [automatic annotation](http://www.uniprot.org/help/automatic%5Fannotation) .

-   The score of an individual entry is the sum of the scores of its annotations.

<!-- -->

-   The score of a proteome is the sum of the scores of the entries that are part of the proteome.

The open-ended interval obtained for these absolute numbers is translated into a **5-point-system**

by splitting it into 5 sub-intervals. Scores in the first interval are represented by "1 point out of 5"

, those in the second by "2 points out of 5", etc. An annotation score of 5 points is therefore associated with the best-annotated entries, and a 1-point-score denotes an entry with rather basic annotation.

There are several contexts in which annotation scores can be used:

-   [UniProtKB](http://www.uniprot.org/help/uniprotkb)  
    The annotation scores can help you to get a quick idea of the relative level of annotation of the entries in your search results. Please note that search results are not ranked by the annotation score, but by a query score that considers not only the annotation scores of the entries that match your query, but also how often (and where) your query term(s) appear in a matching entry and across the whole database, and the importance of a term according to the total number of terms. For this reason, the best ranked entries are not necessarily those with the highest annotation scores.

-   [UniRef](http://www.uniprot.org/help/uniref)  
    UniProt is using annotation scores to select the representative member of a UniRef cluster.

-   [Reference proteomes](http://www.uniprot.org/proteomes)  
    UniProt is using annotation scores to assist the selection of [reference proteomes](http://www.uniprot.org/proteomes) .

Please note that the annotation score **cannot** be used as a measure of the accuracy of the annotation - as we cannot define the 'correct annotation' for any given protein.
