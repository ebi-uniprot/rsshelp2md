This subsection describes interesting single amino acid sites on the sequence that are not defined in any other subsection. This subsection can be displayed in different sections ('Function', 'PTM / Processing', 'Pathology and Biotech') according to its content.

Examples: [P00451](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P00451) , [Q10471](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q10471) , [P80969](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P80969) , [P02730](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P02730)

The 'Site' subsection is frequently used for:

### 1. Cleavage sites {#1\_\_Cleavage_sites}

Example: [P09884](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P09884)

When the protease is known, it is specified:  
Example: [Q8K1S2](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q8K1S2)

Autocatalytic cleavages are specified:  
Example: [Q02936](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q02936)

Related keyword: [Autocatalytic cleavage](http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/68)

### 2. Inhibitory sites for proteases {#2\_\_Inhibitory_sites_for_proteases}

Example: [P00995](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P00995)

When the protease that is subject to inhibition is known, it is specified:  
Example: [P01070](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P01070)

Related keyword: [Protease inhibitor](http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/646)

### 3. Breakpoint sites for fusion proteins due to chromosomal rearrangement {#3\_\_Breakpoint_sites_for_fusion_proteins_due_to_chromosomal_rearrangement}

Example: [Q9UDY8](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q9UDY8)

Related keyword: [Chromosomal rearrangement](http://www.uniprot.org/keywords/160)

Each 'Site' subsection may refer to a single amino acid or to a peptide bond, which is represented by the positions of the two flanking amino acids.
