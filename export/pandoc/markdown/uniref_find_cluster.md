title: How do I check what UniRef cluster my entry belongs to from the UniProtKB entry page?
categories: faq
---

The section "Similar proteins" in a UniProt entry displays a table with tabs for the 3 different UniRef databases, UniRef100, UniRef90 and UniRef50. This table displays the sequences that belong to the same cluster as the entry, and a link to the UniRef cluster view is also provided. Please see P99999.
