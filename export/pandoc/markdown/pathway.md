This subsection of the ['Function'](http://www.uniprot.org/help/function%5Fsection) section describes the metabolic pathway(s) associated with a protein.

Example: [P77731](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P77731#function)

The 'Pathway' subsection uses a structured hierarchy of controlled vocabulary. Each process is split up into 'super-pathway', 'pathway' and/or 'sub-pathway' associated with the protein. When known, the step number mediated by the protein within the pathway is also indicated.

Example: [P20580](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P20580#function)

When the metabolic pathway is not fully known, we only indicate the super-pathway and pathway labels.

Example: [Q47316](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q47316#function)

When a protein participates in different pathways or in different steps of the same pathway, they are all listed on individual lines in the 'Pathway' subsections.

Example: [P00562](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P00562#function)
