  The Jalview application, which is available on alignment result pages via the "Download" dropdown, requires Java Web Start. From the "Download" dropdown, select the "jalview" format. A file with the extension 'jnlp' is downloaded and passed to the program Java Web Start (javaws), which then runs Jalview with the correct data and settings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Java Web Start is installed with Java. You can download Java at
  <a href="http://www.java.com/">
   java.com
  </a>
  .

  After installing Java you may still need to associate the '*.jnlp' files with the program javaws. When selecting jalview from the dropdown, most operating systems will let you open the '*.jnlp' file with a program or to save it on disk:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   If presented with an option to
   <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/use">
    open with
   </a>
   the dropdown list or file dialog to select javaws (Java Web Start). If it is not present in the list, see below for common locations to find javaws.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>
   If you are only given the option to save the '*.jnlp' file, do so. After saving you need to manually associate the javaws program with the file extension '*.jnlp'. How this is done depends on your operating system and desktop environment. Most often it can be done by right-clicking on the downloaded file and choosing "open with".
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Java Web Start is often installed in the following locations:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Windows: Program Files\Java\bin\javaws
  </li>
  <li>
   Mac: /Library/Java/Home/bin/javaws
  </li>
  <li>
   Linux: /usr/bin/javaws or /opt/java/bin/javaws, else try the command 'which javaws'.
  </li>
 </ul>
