  This subsection of the
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/ptm%5Fprocessing%5Fsection">
   PTM / Processing
  </a>
  section indicates that the initiator methionine is cleaved from the mature protein.
 </p>
 <p>
  Example:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9H425#ptm_processing">
   Q9H425
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  Cleavage of the initiator methionine is one of the most common protein modifications and occurs co-translationally.
 </p>
 <p>
  This subsection is only present when cleavage has been experimentally proven or when it can be propagated 'By similarity' with closely related homologs.
  <br/>
  Example:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P31946#ptm%5Fprocessing">
   P31946
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  The comment 'The displayed sequence is further processed into a mature form' is added in the corresponding
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/manual/sequence">
   'Sequence'
  </a>
  section.
