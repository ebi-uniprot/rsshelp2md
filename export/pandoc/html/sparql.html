   SPARQL
  </a>
  is a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%5FWide%5FWeb%5FConsortium">
   W3C
  </a>
  standardized query language for the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic%5FWeb">
   Semantic Web
  </a>
  . If you know SQL, it will look familiar to you and you can do similar types of queries with it. SPARQL also allows you to query and combine data from a variety of SPARQL endpoints, providing a valuable low-cost alternative to building your own data warehouse. You can combine UniProt data from
  <a href="http://sparql.uniprot.org/">
   sparql.uniprot.org
  </a>
  with that from the SPARQL endpoints hosted by the
  <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/rdf/">
   EBI's RDF platform
  </a>
  , the
  <a href="http://snorql.nextprot.org/">
   SIB's neXtProt
  </a>
  SPARQL endpoint, etc.

  The UniProt SPARQL endpoint is free to use. It is updated in sync with the www.uniprot.org and ftp
