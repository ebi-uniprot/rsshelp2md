  This subsection of the
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/function%5Fsection">
   Function
  </a>
  section describes the interaction between a single amino acid and another chemical entity. Priority is given to the annotation of physiological ligands.
 </p>
 <p>
  A group of ligand-binding residues that are separated by no more than three residues is shown as a '
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/manual/region">
   Region
  </a>
  '
 </p>
 <p>
  The general nature of the ligand (substrate, carbohydrate etc.) is indicated in the 'Description field. If defined, the exact chemical composition is also provided.
  <br/>
  Example:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P83790#function">
   P83790
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  When the chemical entity that binds the amino acid is a metal, this information is stored in the '
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/manual/metal">
   Metal binding
  </a>
  ' subsection.
  <br/>
  Example:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P24146#function">
   P24146
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  By default, the interaction involves the amino acid side chain. For interactions mediated via the nitrogen atoms of the histidine side chain, we indicate, when known, which nitrogen is involved: Pros is the term used for the nitrogen atom that is closest to the alpha-carbon, and tele for the other.
  <br/>
  Example:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q57I19#function">
   Q57I19
  </a>
  ,
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P73925#function">
   P73925
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  Interactions which occur via the backbone oxygen or nitrogen are also specified.
  <br/>
  Example:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q8CFV9#function">
   Q8CFV9
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  Interactions are considered to be non-covalent by default. When a substance is covalently bound with a cofactor or a prosthetic group, this is indicated by using the qualifier 'covalent'.
  <br/>
  Example:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P81280#function">
   P81280
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  For residues of enzymes that bind both to the substrate and the product of the reaction we have chosen to indicate binding to the substrate.
  <br/>
  Example:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P08019#function">
   P08019
  </a>
