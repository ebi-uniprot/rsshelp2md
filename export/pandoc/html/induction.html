  This subsection of the 'Expression' section reports the experimentally proven effects of inducers and repressors (usually chemical compounds or environmental factors) on the level of protein (or mRNA) expression (up-regulation, down-regulation, constitutive expression).
 </p>
 <p>
  Example:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q7XTE8#expression">
   Q7XTE8
  </a>
  ,
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P29305#expression">
   P29305
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  Transcriptional regulation by transcription factors or repressors is only rarely described in UniProtKB. In some specific cases, however, we indicate such information without going into details.
 </p>
 <p>
  Example:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q59385#expression">
   Q59385
  </a>
 </p>

  This subsection does not describe the regulation of activity, which can be found in the subsection '
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/manual/activity_regulation">
   Activity regulation
  </a>
  ' for enzymes, transporters and microbial transcription factors, and in other subsections, such as '
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/manual/function">
   Function
  </a>
  '.
