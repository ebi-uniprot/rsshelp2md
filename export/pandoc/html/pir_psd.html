   To avoid duplication of work within UniProtKB,
     PIR-PSD ceased to be maintained as of release 80.00 (31-Dec-2004).
  </p>
  <p>
   All suitable sequences in PIR-PSD that were missing from
     Swiss-Prot + TrEMBL at that time were incorporated into the TrEMBL section
     of UniProtKB. Moreover, all valid references and
     experimentally verified data - present in PIR-PSD, but missing from
     Swiss-Prot + TrEMBL- were also transferred to the relevant
     UniProtKB records.
  </p>
  <p>
   All PIR-PSD data were imported into
   <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/uniparc">
    UniParc
   </a>
   , and bi-directional
     cross-references between UniProtKB (Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL) and PIR-PSD were
     created to allow easy tracking of former PIR-PSD entries.
  </p>
  <p>
   You can access the archived version of PIR-PSD entries via UniProtKB
     cross-references to PIR-PSD.
