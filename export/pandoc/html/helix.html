  This subsection of the
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/structure%5Fsection">
   'Structure'
  </a>
  section is used to indicate the positions of experimentally determined helical regions within the protein sequence.
 </p>
 <p>
  We annotate the positions of alpha-helices, 3(10) helices and Pi-helices in this subsection, corresponding to the DSSP secondary structure element codes 'H', 'G' and 'I', respectively. Note that we do not indicate the exact type of helix.
 </p>
 <p>
  In UniProtKB, the positions of helical regions are neither predicted by computational means, nor propagated 'By similarity' to related species.
