  The
  <a href="http://www.geneontology.org/">
   Gene Ontology (GO)
  </a>
  project provides a set of hierarchical controlled vocabulary split into 3 categories:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Biological process
  </li>
  <li>
   Molecular function
  </li>
  <li>
   Cellular component
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  UniProtKB lists selected terms derived from the GO project. The GO terms derived from the 'Biological process' and Molecular function' categories are listed in the 'Function' section; the GO terms derived from the 'Cellular component' category are listed in the 'Subcellular location' section.
 </p>
 <p>
  GO terms can be manually or electronically assigned to a UniProtKB entry:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Manually assigned GO terms found in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot are associated with one of 15
   <a href="http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml?all">
    GO evidence codes
   </a>
   , as well as with a link to the relevant publication, when available. These GO annotations are tagged with a yellow source/evidence label.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Electronically assigned GO terms are found in UniProtKB/TrEMBL, but to some extent also in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, and are associated with the GO evidence code 'IEA', which means 'inferred from electronic annotation'. These GO annotations are tagged with a blue source/evidence label.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Note that many UniProtKB keywords are manually mapped to GO terms (see document '
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/docs/keywlist">
   Controlled vocabulary of keywords
  </a>
  '), but the resulting GO annotations in UniProtKB appear with a blue label as "inferred from electronic annotation".

  List of GO evidence codes found in UniProtKB
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   EXP: Inferred from Experiment
   <br/>
   Used when experimental results indicate a gene product's function, process involvement or subcellular location.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>
   IBA: Inferred from Biological Aspect of Ancestor
   <br/>
   Used when an aspect of a descendent is inferred through the characterization of an aspect of a ancestral gene.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>
   IC: Inferred by Curator
   <br/>
   Used when annotation is not supported by any evidence, but can be reasonably inferred by a curator from other GO annotations for which evidence is available.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>
   IDA: Inferred from Direct Assay
   <br/>
   Used when a direct assay for the function, process or component indicated by the GO term is available.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>
   HDA: High-throughput Direct Assay
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>
   IEA: Inferred from Electronic Annotation
   <br/>
   Used when annotation derives from computation or automated transfer from a database. These annotations have not been manually checked.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>
   IEP: Inferred from Expression Pattern
   <br/>
   Used when annotation is inferred from the timing or site of expression of a gene.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>
   HEP: High-throughput Expression Pattern
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>
   IGC: Inferred from Genomic Context
   <br/>
   Used when information about the genomic context of a gene product forms part of the evidence for a particular annotation. Genomic context includes, but is not limited to, such things as identity of neighboring genes (i.e. synteny), operon structure, and phylogenetic or other whole genome analysis.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>
   IGI: Inferred from Genetic Interaction
   <br/>
   Used to describe "traditional" genetic interactions, such as suppressors and synthetic lethals, as well as other techniques, such as functional complementation, rescue experiments, or inferences about a gene drawn from the phenotype of a mutation in a different gene.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>
   HGI: High-throughput Genetic Interaction
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>
   IMP: Inferred from Mutant Phenotype
   <br/>
   Used to describe the observations of variations or changes in a gene product, such as mutations or abnormal levels. This includes techniques, such as knockouts, overexpression, anti-sense experiments and use of specific protein inhibitors.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>
   HMP: High-throughput Mutant Phenotype
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>
   IPI: Inferred from Physical Interaction
   <br/>
   Used to cover physical interactions between the gene product of interest and another molecule (ion, complex, etc.).
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>
   ISA: Inferred from Sequence Alignment
   <br/>
   Used when the primary piece of evidence is a pairwise or multiple sequence alignment.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>
   ISM: Inferred from Sequence Model
   <br/>
   Used when any kind of sequence modeling method (e.g. Hidden Markov Models) is the primary piece of evidence
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>
   ISO: Inferred from Sequence Orthology
   <br/>
   Used when the assertion of orthology between the gene product and an experimentally characterized gene product in another organism is the main basis of the annotation
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>
   ISS: Inferred from Sequence or Structural Similarity
   <br/>
   Used for any analysis based on sequence alignment, structure comparison, or evaluation of sequence features, such as composition.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>
   NAS: Non-traceable Author Statement
   <br/>
   Used for statements found in a published article that cannot be traced back to another publication.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>
   TAS: Traceable Author Statement
   <br/>
   Used for information obtained from published articles, mostly reviews, as well as text books or dictionaries, where the original experiments are traceable.
  </li>
 </ul>
