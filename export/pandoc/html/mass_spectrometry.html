  This subsection of the 'Sequence' section reports information derived from mass spectrometry experiments done on the entire protein or on biologically active derived peptide(s).
 </p>
 <p>
  The following information items are provided:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   optionally: the name of an isoform or product of proteolytic cleavage;
  </li>
  <li>
   determined molecular weight (mass) (in Daltons) and, if known, the accuracy or estimated mass error of the MW measurement;
  </li>
  <li>
   ionization method used;
  </li>
  <li>
   link to the corresponding publication.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Additional information, if available, is provided to complement the above information items.

  Example:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/O44185#sequences">
   O44185
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  We do not provide mass spectrometry information for digested peptides, but link to tools which allow to predict the cleavage products, e.g.
  <a href="http://web.expasy.org/peptide%5Fmass">
   PeptideMass
  </a>
  or
  <a href="http://web.expasy.org/peptide%5Fcutter">
   PeptideCutter
  </a>
  . These links are available from the 'Sequence' section (e.g.
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/O44185#sequences">
   O44185
  </a>
  ), via the tools menu whose default selection is "Blast".
