 <p>
  The existence of an agent in the blood that could neutralize diphteria toxin was
  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1749380">
   reported as early as 1890
  </a>
  . Over a century after this major discovery, much is known about immunoglobulins (IG) or antibodies. They are
  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20176268">
   large heterodimeric proteins
  </a>
  made up of 2 heavy (H) chains and 2 light (L) kappa or lambda chains, held together by disulfide bonds to form a 'Y' shaped molecule. Each chain comprises one variable (V) domain at the N-terminal end and one or several (for L and H, respectively) constant (C) domains. The antigen binding site is formed by the V domain of one H chain, together with that of its associated L chain. Thus, each immunoglobulin has 2 antigen binding sites with remarkable affinity for a particular antigen. Each variable domain is encoded by a variable (V) gene, a diversity (D) gene (only for H) and a joining (J) gene which are assembled by a process called
  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24600447">
   V-(D)-J rearrangement
  </a>
  and can then be subjected to somatic hypermutations which, after exposure to antigen and selection, allow affinity maturation for a particular antigen. The resulting rearranged V-(D)-J genes are further spliced to C genes. The C region determines the effector properties and the mechanism used to destroy the antigen, such as activation of complement or binding to Fc receptors.

 <p>
  An immunoglobulin is encoded by 7 genes (IGHV, IGHD, IGHJ, IGHC for the H chain and IGKV, IGKJ, IGKC for a kappa or IGLV, IGLJ or IGLC for a lambda L chain). The human genome contains 176 functional immunoglobulin genes clustered in 3 loci, IGH on chromosome 14 (50 V, 23 D, 6 J and 9 C), IGK on chromosome 2 (40 V, 5 J and 1 C) and IGL on chromosome 22 (32 V, 5 J and 5 C). During the development of B cells, the mechanisms of diversity involved in the immunoglobulin synthesis (combinatorial V-(D)-J diversity, junctional diversity and somatic hypermutations) lead to the huge potential antibody repertoire of each individual, estimated to comprise 10
  <sup>

  </sup>
  different immunoglobulins, the limiting factor being only the number of B cells that an organism is genetically programmed to produce.
