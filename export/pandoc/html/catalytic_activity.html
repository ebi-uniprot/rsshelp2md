  This subsection of the
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/function%5Fsection">
   Function
  </a>
  section describes the catalytic activity of an enzyme, i.e. a chemical reaction that the enzyme catalyzes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Historically, UniProt has followed the recommendations of the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (
  <a href="http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/">
   NC-IUBMB
  </a>
  ) for the description of enzymatic activities, except for reactions that are described in the scientific literature, but that are not (yet) covered by the NC-IUBMB. The focus of the NC-IUBMB is the nomenclature and classification of enzymes by the reactions they catalyze. For this purpose the NC-IUBMB typically describes an exemplary reaction for each class of enzymes, with the understanding that individual members of the class may use alternative reactants. The NC-IUBMB use their own names for the reactants.
 </p>
 <p>
  To allow the curation of reactions at the level of specific enzymes instead of enzyme classes, and to use standardized names for reactants, we use chemical reaction descriptions from the
  <a href="https://www.rhea-db.org/">
   Rhea
  </a>
  database whenever possible.
  <br/>
  Example:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/O36015">
   O36015
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  For catalytic activities that can only be described in the form of free text, we continue to follow the NC-IUBMB descriptions.
  <br/>
  Example:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P17050">
   P17050
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  We also curate the physiological direction of a reaction, i.e. the direction of the net flow of reactants
  <em>
   in vivo
  </em>
  , where evidence is available for it.
  <br/>
  Example:
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/A0A0S3QTD0">
   A0A0S3QTD0
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to their focus on nomenclature, cross-references to
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme%5FCommission%5Fnumber">
   Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers
  </a>
  have historically been added to the
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/protein%5Fnames">
   Protein names
  </a>
  subsection of UniProtKB entries. To link the EC numbers to the reactions on which they are based, they are also added to 'Catalytic activity' annotations.
 </p>
 <p>
  A description of how Catalytic activity annotation is represented in the various formats in which UniProt entries are distributed, is included in the corresponding
