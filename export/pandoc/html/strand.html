  This subsection of the
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/structure%5Fsection">
   'Structure'
  </a>
  section is used to indicate the positions of experimentally determined beta strands within the protein sequence.
 </p>
 <p>
  We annotate the positions of hydrogen-bonded beta strands (or extended strands) and residues in isolated beta bridges, corresponding to the DSSP secondary structure codes 'E' and 'B', respectively.
 </p>
 <p>
  In UniProtKB, the positions of beta strands are neither predicted by computational means, nor propagated 'By similarity' to related species.
