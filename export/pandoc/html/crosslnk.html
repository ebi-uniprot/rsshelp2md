  This subsection of the
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/help/ptm%5Fprocessing%5Fsection">
   PTM / Processing
  </a>
  section describes
  <strong>
   covalent linkages
  </strong>
  of various types formed
  <strong>
   between two proteins (interchain cross-links)
  </strong>
  or
  <strong>
   between two parts of the same protein (intrachain cross-links)
  </strong>
  , except the disulfide bonds that are annotated in the
  <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/manual/disulfid">
   'Disulfide bond'
  </a>
  subsection.
 </p>
 <p>
  Interchain cross-links are involved in the formation of covalently linked protein complexes. Common cross-links include ubiquitin (and ubiquitin-like)(Ubl) conjugation, SUMOylation, transglutamination, thioether bonds and thioester bonds.
 </p>
 <p>
  For each cross-link, we specify the name of the conjugate and the identity of the two amino acids involved in the 'Description' field. There is a strict controlled vocabulary for the description of cross-link types.

  1. Intrachain cross-links
 </h3>
 <p>
  For intrachain cross-links, we cite the amino acids involved in their order of appearance in the sequence.

  Examples:

  Note that the intrachain cross-link of the C-terminus with the N-terminus results in the formation of a cyclopeptide:

  2. Interchain cross-links

 <p>
  For interchain cross-links we give the identity of the two amino acids involved, the amino acid in the partner protein cited in second position. We also indicate that the linkage is interchain and provide the name of the partner protein.

 <p>
  Cross-links between individual subunits of a homodimer are annotated as interchain cross-links and use the same syntax as above, except that the name of the protein is not indicated.

  a. Ubiquitin and Ubiquitin-like conjugation
 </h4>
 <p>
  Ubiquitin (Ubl) conjugation includes conjugation of ubiquitin and of related proteins, which are collectively referred to as modifiers. Ubl conjugation requires the concerted action of several enzymes which act in a stepwise process. Ubl is activated by an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme and then transferred from E1 to the active site cysteine of a Ubl-conjugating enzyme E2. The final step of the ubiquitylation process generally requires the activity of a specific E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, which functions as a specific substrate recognition module of the system. Ubl conjugation is reversible.

  <strong>
   Ubiquitination
  </strong>
  <br/>
  Ubiquitination often leads to the degradation of the modified protein by the proteasome.

   Sumoylation
  </strong>
  <br/>
  Sumoylation is involved in the nuclear retention of proteins that normally shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm and in the targeting of proteins to specific subnuclear structures.

   Neddylation
  </strong>
  <br/>
  Neddylation is the conjugation of NEDD8 (known as 'Rub' in plants). The substrates are proteins of the cullin family, that are themselves E3 enzymes involved in ubiquitination. Neddylation of cullins may control ubiquitination level.

 <h4 id="b__Transglutamination">
  b. Transglutamination
 </h4>
 <p>
  Transglutamination is catalyzed by transglutaminases that cross-link glutamine with lysine. Under physiological conditions, tranglutamination of intermediate filaments and their associated proteins is essential for the formation of the protective cornified cell envelope that contributes to the structure of the skin barrier. Aberrant non-reversible transglutamination is implicated in various diseases of the skin and in Alzheimer disease.
