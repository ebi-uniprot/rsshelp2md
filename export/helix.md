This subsection of the ['Structure'](http://www.uniprot.org/help/structure%5Fsection) section is used to indicate the positions of experimentally determined helical regions within the protein sequence.

We annotate the positions of alpha-helices, 3(10) helices and Pi-helices in this subsection, corresponding to the DSSP secondary structure element codes 'H', 'G' and 'I', respectively. Note that we do not indicate the exact type of helix.

In UniProtKB, the positions of helical regions are neither predicted by computational means, nor propagated 'By similarity' to related species.
