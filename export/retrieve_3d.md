1 - Retrieve all UniProtKB entries for which the 3D structure is known

Using the query builder:

- Select**Search in**: `Protein Knowledgebase (UniProtKB)`
- Click**Advanced Search Â»** to open the query builder
- Select**Field**: `Cross-reference [DR]`
- Select**Database**: `PDB`
- Click**Add & Search**
- Depending on your interests, choose amongst the following:
Show only`reviewed` (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot) or `unreviewed` (UniProtKB/TrEMBL) entries
- **[result (reviewed entries only)](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=database%3Apdb+AND+reviewed%3Ayes)**.

2 - Retrieve all proteins with 3D structures determined by Electron microscopy (EM)

Other methods: Model, X-ray, NMR, Neutron (Neutron diffraction), Fiber (Fiber diffraction), IR (Infrared spectroscopy)

Using the query builder:

- Select**Search in**: `Protein Knowledgebase (UniProtKB)`
- Type`Method:EM`
- Click**Search**
- Depending on your interests, choose amongst the following:
Show only`reviewed` (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot) or `unreviewed` (UniProtKB/TrEMBL) entries
- **[result (reviewed entries only)](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=method%3Aem+AND+reviewed%3Ayes)**.
- You can combine query such as: "myoglobin AND method:X-ray":
- **[result](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=myoglobin+AND+method%3AX-ray)**.
